<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The JMdict/EDICT project has as its goal the production of a freely available 
Japanese/English Dictionary in machine-readable form. </P>
<P>The project began in 1991 with the expansion of the "EDICT" simple 
Japanese-English dictionary file. (See below under History) </P>
<P>At present the project has the following dictionary files available: </P>
<UL>
  <P></P>
  <LI>the full JMdict file in XML format. The JMdict file is aimed at being a 
  multilingual lexical database with Japanese as the pivot language and also 
  includes translations of words and phrases in a number of languages other than 
  English. More information is available from the <A 
  href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/j_jmdict.html">JMdict overview page. 
  </A>
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT file, which contains a reduced amount of information, and is 
  provided to maintain support for software which uses the original EDICT file 
  format. A short <A href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html">EDICT 
  overview page </A>is available which lists some of the software which uses 
  this file; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT2 file, which is in an expanded format and contains almost all 
  the information in the JMdict file; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT_SUB file, which contains about 20% of the most common entries in 
  the EDICT file. </LI></UL>
<P>An internal database is used to hold all the data associated with the 
project, and the files are generated from using conversion utility software. 
</P>
<P>The files are copyright, and distributed in accordance with the Licence 
Statement, which can found at the WWW site of the <A 
href="http://www.edrdg.org/">Electronic Dictionary Research and Development 
Group </A>who are the owners of the copyright. </P>
<P><A name=IREF01>
<H2>CURRENT VERSION &amp; DOWNLOAD</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The project's master database is continuously being updated and new versions 
of the file are generated daily. The date of generation is included in the 
header of the file. </P>
<P>The files are currently distributed via the Monash University <A 
href="http://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/00INDEX.html">ftp server, 
</A>which also provides an rsync service. The main files available are: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="http://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/JMdict.gz">JMdict.gz 
  </A>- the full JMdict file, including English, German, French, Russian and 
  Dutch glosses; 
  <LI><A href="http://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/JMdict_e.gz">JMdict_e.gz 
  </A>- the JMdict file with only English glosses; 
  <LI><A href="http://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict.gz">edict.gz </A>- 
  the "traditional" EDICT file; 
  <LI><A href="http://ftp.cc.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/edict2.gz">edict2.gz 
  </A>- the extended EDICT2 file. </LI></UL>

<H2>PROJECT FORUM</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The are several forums where this project is actively discussed. </P>
<P>The original forum was the <TT>sci.lang.japan</TT> <A 
href="http://groups.google.com/group/sci.lang.japan">Usenet newsgroup. </A>More 
recently a <A href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edict-jmdict/">mailing list 
</A>specifically for project discussion has begun. (Mail to 
<TT>edict-jmdict-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</TT> to initiate subscription.) </P>
<P><A name=IREF02>
<H2>FORMAT</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The basic format of the entries in the dictionary files can be seen in detail 
by examining the <A 
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict_dtd_h.html">DTD </A>(Document 
Type Declaration) of the XML-format JMdict file. The DTD is heavily annotated 
with content and structural information. </P>
<P>In summary, each dictionary entry is independent, although there may be 
cross-reference fields pointing to other entries. Each entry consists of </P>
<OL type=a>
  <P></P>
  <LI>kanji elements, i.e. headwords containing at least one kanji character, 
  plus associated tags indicating some status or characteristic of the headword. 
  Where there are multiple headwords, they have been ordered according to 
  frequency of usage, as far as this can be determined; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>reading elements, containing either the reading in kana of the headword, 
  or the headword itself in the case of headwords only in kana. The elements 
  also include tags indicating some status or characteristics. As with the kanji 
  headwords, where there are multiple readings they have been ordered according 
  to frequency of usage, as far as this can be determined; 
  <P></P>
  <LI>general coded information relating to the entry as a whole, such as 
  original language, date-of-creation, etc. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>sense elements, containing the translational equivalents or glosses of the 
  headword(s). As Japanese is not highly polysemous, there is often only one 
  sense. Associated with the sense elements is other coded data indicating the 
  part-of-speech, field of application, miscellaneous information, etc. As with 
  headwords and readings, the glosses are ordered with the most common appearing 
  first. </LI></OL>
<P>The format and coding of the distributed files is as follows: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <P></P>
  <LI>the JMdict file contains the complete dictionary information in XML format 
  as per the <A href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict_dtd_h.html">DTD. 
  </A>This file is in Unicode/ISO-10646 coding using UTF-8 encapsulation. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT file is in a relatively simple format based on the text data 
  file of the SKK input-method. Each entry is in the form: 
  <P></P>
  <DL>
    <DD>KANJI [KANA] /(general information) gloss/gloss/.../ </DD></DL>
  <P>or </P>
  <P></P>
  <DL>
    <DD>KANA /(general information) gloss/gloss/.../ </DD></DL>
  <P>Where there are multiple senses, these are indicated by (1), (2), etc. 
  before the first gloss in each sense. As this format only allows a single 
  kanji headword and reading, entries are generated for each possible 
  headword/reading combination. As the format restricts Japanese characters to 
  the kanji and kana fields, any cross-reference data and other informational 
  fields are omitted. </P>
  <P>The EDICT file is distributed in JIS X 0208 coding in EUC-JP encapsulation; 
  </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT2 file is in an expanded form of the original EDICT format. The 
  main differences are the inclusion of multiple kanji headwords and readings, 
  and the inclusion of cross-reference and other information fields, e.g.: 
  <P></P>
  <DL>
    <DD>KANJI-1;KANJI-2 [KANA-1;KANA-2] /(general information) (see xxxx) 
    gloss/gloss/.../ </DD></DL>
  <P>The EDICT2 file is also distributed in JIS X 0208 coding in EUC-JP 
  encapsulation; </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>the EDICT_SUB file is in the same format as the EDICT file. 
  <P></P></LI></OL>
<P>None of the files have the entries in any particular order. </P>
<P><A name=IREF03>
<H2>PROJECT HISTORY</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The project was begun in 1991 by the current editor <A 
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/">(Jim Breen) </A>when an early 
DOS-based Japanese word-processor (MOKE - Mark's Own Kanji Editor) was released, 
containing an initial small version of the EDICT file. This was progressively 
expanded and edited over the following years. In 1999 the EDICT, which by this 
time contained about 60,000 entries, was converted into an expanded format and 
the first XML-format JMdict file released. The EDICT2 format was created in 
2003, primarily for use with the <A 
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdic.html">WWWJDIC </A>dictionary 
server. </P>
<P>The growth in entries in the file is largely due to the efforts of Jim and 
the many people who contributed entries to it over the years. The increase in 
entry numbers has slowed as the file has achieved coverage of a large proportion 
of the Japanese lexicon. Much of the editorial work in recent years has 
concentrated on amendments and expansion to existing entries. </P>
<P>A more expanded explanation of the early developments in the EDICT file can 
be found in the <A 
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict_doc_old.html">original 
documentation. </A></P>
<P><A name=IREF04>
<H2>COPYRIGHT</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>Dictionary copyright is a difficult point, because clearly the first 
lexicographer who published "inu means dog" could not claim a copyright 
violation over all subsequent Japanese dictionaries. While it is usual to 
consult other dictionaries for "accurate lexicographic information", as Nelson 
put it, wholesale copying is, of course, not permissible, and contributors have 
been advised to avoid direct copying from other sources. What makes each 
dictionary unique (and copyright-able) is the particular selection of words, the 
phrasing of the meanings, the presentation of the contents (a very important 
point in the case of this project), and the means of publication. </P>
<P>The files of the project are copyright, and distributed in accordance with 
the Licence Statement, which can found at the WWW site of the <A 
href="http://www.edrdg.org/">Electronic Dictionary Research and Development 
Group </A>who are the current owners of the copyright. As explained in the 
licence, the files are available for use for most purposes provided 
acknowledgement and distribution of the documentation is made. </P>

<H2>LEXICOGRAPHICAL DETAILS</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<OL type=A>
  <LI>Inflections, etc. 
  <P>In general no inflections of verbs or adjectives have been included, except 
  in idiomatic expressions. Adverbs formed from adjectives (e.g., -ku or -ni) 
  are generally not included. Verbs are, of course, in the plain or "dictionary" 
  form. </P>
  <P>Composed forms, such as adverbs taking the "to" particle, keiyoudoushi 
  adjectives, etc. are only included in their root from, however the 
  part-of-speech (POS) marker is used to indicate their status. </P>
  <P>Nouns which can form a verb withe the auxiliary verb "suru" only appear in 
  their noun form, but have a POS marker: "vs", to indicate the existence of a 
  verbal form. In general the gloss only relates to the noun itself, but entries 
  are being progressively expanded to include the verbal glosses as well. </P>

  <LI>Word Priority Marking 
  <P>The ke_pri and equivalent re_pri fields in the JMdict file are provided to 
  record information about the relative commonness or priority of the entry, and 
  consist of codes indicating the word appears in various references which can 
  be taken as an indication of the frequency with which the word is used. This 
  field is intended for use either by applications which want to concentrate on 
  entries of a particular priority, or to generate subset files. The current 
  values in this field are: </P>
  <OL type=a>
    <LI>news1/2: appears in the "wordfreq" file compiled by Alexandre Girardi 
    from the Mainichi Shimbun. (See the Monash ftp archive for a copy.) Words in 
    the first 12,000 in that file are marked "news1" and words in the second 
    12,000 are marked "news2". 
    <LI>ichi1/2: appears in the "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", Senmon Kyouiku 
    Publishing, Tokyo, 1998. (The entries marked "ichi2" were demoted from ichi1 
    because they were observed to have low frequencies in the WWW and 
    newspapers.) 
    <LI>spec1 and spec2: a small number of words use this marker when they are 
    detected as being common, but are not included in other lists. 
    <LI>gai1/2: common loanwords, also based on the wordfreq file. 
    <LI>nfxx: this is an indicator of frequency-of-use ranking in the wordfreq 
    file. "xx" is the number of the set of 500 words in which the entry can be 
    found, with "01" assigned to the first 500, "02" to the second, and so on. 
    </LI></OL>
  <P>Entries with news1, ichi1, spec1 and gai1 values are marked with a "(P)" in 
  the EDICT and EDICT2 files. </P>
  <P>While the priority markings accurately reflect the status of entries with 
  regard to the various sources, they must be seen as only providing a crude 
  indication of how common a word or expression actually is in Japanese. The 
  "(P)" markings in the EDICT and EDICT2 files appear to identify a useful 
  subset of "common" words, but there are clearly some marked entries which are 
  not very common, and there are clearly unmarked entries which are in common 
  use, particularly in the spoken language. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Okurigana Variants 
  <P>Okurigana variants in headwords are handled by including each variant form 
  as a headword. This is to enable software to match with variant forms. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Spellings 
  <P>As far as possible variants of English translation and spelling are 
  included. Where appropriate different translations are included for national 
  variants (e.g. autumn/fall, tap/faucet, etc.). Common spelling variations such 
  as -our/-or and -ize/-ise are handled either by repeating the gloss in both 
  spellings or appending spelling variants in parentheses. No attempt is made to 
  tag English spellings according to country of usage. </P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Gairaigo and Regional Words 
  <P>For gairaigo which have not been derived from English words, the source 
  language and the word in that language are included. Languages have been coded 
  in the two-letter codes from the ISO 639-2:1998 "Codes for the representation 
  of names of languages" standard, e.g. "(fre: avec)" in the EDICT/EDICT2 files 
  and &lt;lsource xml:lang="fre"&gt;avec&lt;/lsource&gt; in the JMdict file. In 
  the case of gairaigo which have a meaning which is not apparent from the 
  original (usually English) words, the words in the source language are 
  included as: (trans: original words). </P>
  <P>A number of tags are used to indicate that a word or phrase is associated 
  with a particular regional language variant within Japan. The tags are: </P>
  <P></P><PRE>kyb	Kyoto-ben

<H2>OTHER LANGUAGES</H2></A>
<P></P>
<P>The JMdict file has the capacity to record glosses for Japanese headwords in 
many languages. Although not maintained as part of the current project, the full 
JMdict file includes glosses for a large number of entries in French and German, 
and a smaller number of entries in Russian and Dutch. </P>
<P>The sources for the main non-English glosses are: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>the French material (58,000 entries) come from two sources: 
  <UL>
    <LI>a 17,000 entry Japanese-French dictionary file from the <A 
    href="http://dico.fj.free.fr/">Dictionnaire français-japonais </A>project 
    being undertaken by Jean-Marc Desperrier. As Jean-Marc says on that page, 
    his project's aim "est de traduire en français une partie du dictionnaire 
    japonais-anglais Edict de Jim Breen". His project is continuing and is being 
    supported by a number of French speakers; 
    <LI>about 41,000 entries from a dictionary compiled by <A 
    href="http://francais.sourceforge.jp/">le projet francais pour francophone 
    </A>This file, which also appears to be based around translating the EDICT 
    file, has been made by selecting the entries not already in Jean-Marc's 
    file, and converting them to EDICT format. These entries have "JF2" at the 
    end of them. <I>(There is some evidence that this file may</I> <I>use 
    translations generated by an online resource such as Babelfish.)</I>
