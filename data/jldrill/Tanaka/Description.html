<H1 alignenter>The Tanaka Corpus</H1>
<P></P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The page provides some brief documentation for the Tanaka Corpus of parallel
Japanese-English sentences, and in particular the modification and
	  editing that has been carried out to enable use of the corpus as
	  a source of examples in the WWWJDIC dictionary server and other systems. </P>
<P>The corpus was compiled by Professor Yasuhito Tanaka at Hyogo
	  University and his students, as described in his <A0
href http://afnlp.org/pacling2001/pdf/tanaka.pdf">Pacling2001
	</A>paper. At Pacling2001 Professor Tanaka released copies of the
	  corpus, and stated that it is in the public domain. According to
	  Professor Christian Boitet, Professor Tanaka did not think the
	  collection was of a very good standard. (Sadly, Prof. Tanaka died in early 2003.) </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Compilation</H2>
<P>Professor Tanaka's students were given the task of collecting 300
	  sentence pairs each. After several years, 212,000 sentence pairs had been collected </P>
<P>From inspection, it appears that many of the sentence pairs have
	  been derived from textbooks, e.g. books used by Japanese
	  students of English. Some are lines of songs, others are from popular books and Biblical passages. </P>
<P>The original collection contained large numbers of errors, both in
	  the Japanese and English. Many of the errors were in spelling
	  and transcription, although in a significant number of cases the
	  Japanese and English contained grammatical, syntactic,
	  etc. errors, or the translations did not match at all. </P>
<P>The original file can still be downloaded (see below.) </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Modifications to the Corpus</H2>
<P>As described below, the Tanaka Corpus has been edited and adapted
	  to be used within the <A
		href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C">WWWJDIC </A>dictionary server as a set of example sentences associated with words in the dictionary. In order to adapt the corpus for this role, it has been edited as follows: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>an initial regularization of the punctuation of the Japanese and
		English   sentences was carried out, then duplicate pairs were
		removed, reducing the   original file from 210,000 pairs to 180,000 pairs;
  <LI>sentences which differed only by differences in orthography (e.g.
  kana/kanji usage, okurigana differences), numbers, proper names, minor 
  grammatical points such as plain/polite verb usage, etc. were
		reduced to   single representative examples;
  <LI>sentences where the Japanese consisted of a short Japanese
		statement in   kana were removed;
  <LI>sentences with spelling errors, kana-kanji conversion errors,
		etc. were   corrected;
  <LI>sentences where the English version did not match the Japanese
		were edited   to make the two versions agree;
  <LI>where the sentences contain gender-specific language or words,
		the English   portion has been tagged with [M] or [F] respectively;
  <LI>sentences where the Japanese was too garbled to derive a valid
		English   equivalent were removed. </LI></OL>
<P>The process described above is ongoing, and at present the edited
		corpus has just over 160,000 sentence pairs. </P>
<P>In addition a small number of additional sentence pairs have been
		added to provided examples of the usage of Japanese words and
		phrases not present in the original corpus. </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Incorporation into the WWWJDIC Server</H2>
<P>(The incorporation of the Tanaka Corpus in the WWWJDIC server is
		described in a <A =
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/papillon/dicexamples.html">paper
		</A>presented to the 2003 <A href="http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/Home.po">Papillon =
</A>workshop.) </P>
<P>In order to facilitate the linking of sentences in the Corpus to
		words in the online dictionary, a list of Japanese words and
		phrases was extracted from each sentence. This was carried out
		using the Chasen morphological analysis program. Compound
		words which had dictionary entries were recombined as
		necessary. At present about 27,000 unique Japanese words and phrases are indexed. </P>
<P>The list of words associated with each sentence is used by the
		WWWJDIC server to select examples of the usage of the
		words. In addition, users of the WWWJDIC server can search the
		Corpus using text strings in Japanese and/or English, and
		using regular expressions. Users can also submit corrections
		to sentences via a WWW feedback form. Several thousand
		corrections have been submitted this way. </P>
<P>More information on the WWWJDIC use of the corpus in in the <A
		href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdicinf.html#examp_tag">documentation.
		</A></P>
<P>To see an example of the sentence linking, <A href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1Q%C2%E7%B=
3%D8%C0%B8_1_">here</A>is the sentence display for
		=C2=E7=B3=D8=C0=B8. There is also a function for <A

		</A>the sentences. </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Current Format</H2>
<P>The file is in text format, with the Japanese in either EUC-JP or
		UTF8 encoding. If you wish to have it in any other format or
		coding, you will have to convert it yourself. </P>
<P>The format is as follows: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>the file consists of pairs of lines, beginning with "A: " and
		"B: "   respectively. There are also comment lines which begin
		with a "#". In many   cases these are A:/B: lines that have
		been removed from the file as far as   WWWJDIC is concerned.
  <LI>the "A:" lines contain the Japanese sentence and the English
		translation,   separated by a TAB character. At the end of the
		English translation is a   sequence number identifying the sentence pair. It is in the format:0
  #ID nnn. This sequence number is used to identify the pair uniquely
		across   several projects using the file.
  <LI>the "B:" lines contain a space-delimited list of Japanese words
		found in   the preceding sentence.
  <LI>the Japanese words in the "B:" lines can have the following
		appended:   <OL type=i>
    <LI>a reading in hiragana. This is to resolve cases where the word
		can be     read different ways. WWWJDIC uses this to ensure that only the =
appropriate
    sentences are linked. The reading is in "round" parentheses.
    <LI>a sense number. This occurs when the word has multiple senses
		in the     EDICT file, and indicates which sense applies in
		the sentence. WWWJDIC     displays these numbers. The sense number is in "square" parentheses.
    <LI>the form in which the word appears in the sentence. This will
		differ     from the indexing word if it has been inflected,
		for example. This field is     in "curly" parentheses.
    <LI>a "~" character to indicate that the sentence pair is a good
		and checked     example of the usage of the word. Words are
		marked to enable appropriate     sentences to be selected by
		dictionary software. Typically only one instance     per sense
		of a word will be marked. The WWWJDIC server displays these     sentences below the display of the related dictionary entry.

<P></P>
<H2>Subset</H2>
<P>An automatically-generated subset of the edited corpus is also
		available. The generation selects sentences at random, while
		ensuring that all the indexed words continue to be
		represented. The subset is about 30% the size of the full file. </P>
<P><A name=tanaka_warning></A> </P>
<H2>A Warning to Users</H2>
<P>The Corpus is a useful and interesting collection of matched
		Japanese and English sentence pairs, however it cannot be
		regarded as containing natural or representative examples of
		text in either language. This is because of the way it was
		originally compiled and the artificial nature of the
		sources. Also it still contains a large number of errors and
		repetitions. It certainly should not be used for any
		statistical analyses of the text. While the Corpus appears to
		be adequate and useful as a source of examples of word usage,
		the user is advised to be cautious and critical. The following points should be considered:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>the sentences were typed in by students in order to meet a work
  requirement. Initially there were many mistakes both in the Japanese
  and   English. While many have been corrected some still remain.
  <LI>some clearly contain translations into Japanese of English
  sentences, and   often do not represent the most natural way things
  are said in Japanese   (overuse of pronouns, etc.).
  <LI>others contain English translations which are very literal
  translations of   the Japanese, and perhaps came from simple machine
  translation systems.   <LI>it should be noted that many of the
  sentences are of the kinds found in   older "study for entrance exam
  books", and thus are likely to have contrived   examples of grammar
  usage or slightly archaic English examples passed down   from
  generation to generation by (Japanese) English teachers. They are
  not   examples of normally-used modern English, and should not
  always be regarded as   suitable for English study.
  <LI>please DO NOT use the original file without exercising
  considerable   caution. It contains thousands of errors and
  duplications in both the Japanese   and English sentences. If any
  project wants to use the Tanaka material, it is   STRONGLY recommended that the updated file is used.
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<P>While the corpus may be freely downloaded and used in servers,
  etc. two special requests are made: </P>
<OL type=a>
  <LI>that some facility be made for regular download and
		incorporation of new   versions. The corpus is being regularly
		edited and updated and it is a pity to   see already-corrected errors still on display in other systems.
  <LI>people using copies of the corpus in servers and other systems
		should make   clear to their users that errors, etc. as
		described above exist in the corpus. 
  <LI>corrections made to the corpus be relayed back to me so that the
		original   can be improved as well. </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<H2>Copyright?</H2>
<P>The file is in the Public Domain. Professor Tanaka made the
		original file available on this basis, and although many hours
		have been spent editing it and adding the indices, I don't think its status should be other than freely 
available. <B>However, </B>if you are using the file in a system, it
		would be polite to mention where you got it, and provide a link back to this
page. </P>
<P></P>
<H2>Downloads</H2>
<P>The original file is available from
		<A=href="ftp://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/tanakacorp_utf8.gz">here
		</A>(in UTF8 coding) or <A href p://ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/tanakacorp_euc.gz">here
</A>(in EUC-JP coding). <FONT color=red>(Please do not use these
		versions in projects. See the warning above.)</FONT> </P>
<P>The edited version used in the WWWJDIC server can be downloaded from:

<P></P>
<H2>Other Projects</H2>
<P>A number of projects in addition to WWWJDIC use the Tanaka corpus
	  as a source of example sentences for Japanese words. </P>
<P>The <A href="http://tatoeba.fr/">Tatoeba Project </A>is expanding
	  the corpus to include translations of the sentences in other European languages.
</P>
<P></P>
<H2>And Closing...</H2>
<P>Many people have played a part in editing the examples file, and
	  extending and correcting the indices. I particularly wish to
	  acknowledge the contribution of Paul Blay, whose work
	  significantly improved the indices, including the creation of all the {} extensions. Paul is currently maintaining the
file. </P>
