I was worried about distributing these files with a GPL licensed
application.  Because the application might get distributed in a
"commercial" setting, I was afraid that I might be in violation of the
license.  So I subsequently asked for a modification the to license.
Here is the response:

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your e-mail. I'm glad you found these files useful. As a matter of
fact, when I made these files, I thought little about licensing issues and
"prohibited" a commercial use with no particular reason. Now I know a little
more about these issues and think there is no reason to prohibit it. I am happy
when I receive an e-mail from people who say there are using these files in
Japanese-related software but I don't really care whether that software is
commercial or not. So I have decided to change the header of these files and
only ask the user to include somewhere a mention of the source (i.e me or my
Web site). You can use these files as you like (GPL or other).

Cheers,

Thierry

This is a really amazing response from a great guy.  The JLPT files
represent quite a large amount of work and I am extremely grateful to
be allowed to use them in JLDrill.  I have noticed some applications
in the past using these files without attribution and it's very sad.
PLEASE if you use these files, comply with Thierry's request.  All he
wants is to be recognized for the work that he's put in and to be
given the pleasure of knowing his effort is being used by people.
