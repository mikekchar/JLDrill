The kana files (hiragana.utf and katakana.utf) were created by Mike
Charlton <mikekchar@gmail.com>.  Please feel free to use them in
anyway you like.  I place no restrictions on them.  However, if you
improve the files, please consider contributing the improvements back
to me.  That way everyone can benefit.

Thanks
