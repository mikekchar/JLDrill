The kana files (hiragana.utf, katakana.utf, kana.dat) were created by Mike
Charlton <mikekchar@gmail.com>.  Please feel free to use them in
anyway you like.  I place no restrictions on them.  However, if you
improve the files, please consider contributing the improvements back
to me.  That way everyone can benefit.

If it is possible in your country, I place these in the public
domain.  However in some countries it is not possible to waive
certain moral rights.  Therefore, if public domain is not possible
in your country I grant you a non-exclusive license to use these
files in any way you see fit.
