jldrill (0.4.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crash when editing vocabulary.  Still not sure what the exact
    problem is, but the extra robustness should have been there
    originally.

jldrill (0.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug in the scheduler.  Through code inspection, some of the
    math was wrong.  Modify the backoff in the scheduling algorith.
    Before the backoff was always a factor of 2.  Now it varies from
    2 to 1.  The longer the elapsed time, the less the backoff.  That
    means that items which have gone for 180 days and are reviewed
    at 1.0 or less will be reviewed at 180 days again.

jldrill (0.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some problems with scheduling.  There is now a maximum
    schedule of twice the previous duration plus 25 percent.
    That way if you don't review for a long time you aren't
    deprived of repetitions.  There is also a minimum schedule
    of the previous duration.  Having a smaller duration isn't
    really a problem, but it's confusing when you look at the
    stats.

    to see the items appear again for other problem types.
