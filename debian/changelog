jldrill (0.4.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some refactoring. Mainly I'm making this package because Context
    has changed.  I just want to have debian packages for both.

 -- Mike Charlton <mikekchar@gmail.com>  Wed, 20 Oct 2010 10:56:00 +0900

jldrill (0.4.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * There are now progress bars for everything that loads.  I will
    have to do some testing to see if there are any side effects
    that you can have (like saving while you are loading).  The 
    downside to the progress bars is that it slows down loading.  But
    I think the benefit outweighs the disadvantage.

jldrill (0.4.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the middle of refactoring.  But if you delete a view from
    the development code it will still get picked up from the
    installed code.  So this is simply a new package that I can install
    while developing the new code.  Nobody else should need this version.

jldrill (0.4.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow only comments to be entered in the edit window.  Also, don't
    clobber the comments when inserting vocabulary from the dictionary.

jldrill (0.4.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crash when editing vocabulary.  Still not sure what the exact
    problem is, but the extra robustness should have been there
    originally.

 -- Mike Charlton <mikekchar@gmail.com>  Mon, 28 Jul 2010 11:07:00 +0900

jldrill (0.4.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

jldrill (0.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a bug in the scheduler.  Through code inspection, some of the
    math was wrong.  Modify the backoff in the scheduling algorith.
    Before the backoff was always a factor of 2.  Now it varies from
    2 to 1.  The longer the elapsed time, the less the backoff.  That
    means that items which have gone for 180 days and are reviewed
    at 1.0 or less will be reviewed at 180 days again.

jldrill (0.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some problems with scheduling.  There is now a maximum
    schedule of twice the previous duration plus 25 percent.
    That way if you don't review for a long time you aren't
    deprived of repetitions.  There is also a minimum schedule
    of the previous duration.  Having a smaller duration isn't
    really a problem, but it's confusing when you look at the
    stats.

jldrill (0.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    the item only once.  But on subsequent sessions you are likely
    to see the items appear again for other problem types.
