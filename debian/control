Description: Japanese language drill program
 JLDrill is a program for helping people study and drill various aspects 
 of the Japanese language. Current features include a variety of drills
 (kana, vocabulary, grammar) a kanji and dictionary reference tool
 inspired by the firefox plugin Rikaichan, kanji stroke order
 diagrams, and vocabulary collocations using the Tanaka corpus (a
 series of example sentences in English and Japanese).  JLDrill's
 drills use a spaced repetition algorithm which is unique to it.
 This algorithm helps with initial acquisition of vocabulary, automatic
 grading of item difficulty and ability to deal with inconsistant
 review schedules.
