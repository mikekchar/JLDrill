This software contains the JLPT files from Thierry Bézecourt.  Here is
the original copyright notification.

I was worried about distributing these files with a GPL licensed
application.  Because the application might get distributed in a
"commercial" setting, I was afraid that I might be in violation of the
license.  So I subsequently asked for a modification the to license.
Here is the response:

Hi Mike,

Thanks for your e-mail. I'm glad you found these files useful. As a matter of
fact, when I made these files, I thought little about licensing issues and
"prohibited" a commercial use with no particular reason. Now I know a little
more about these issues and think there is no reason to prohibit it. I am happy
when I receive an e-mail from people who say there are using these files in
Japanese-related software but I don't really care whether that software is
commercial or not. So I have decided to change the header of these files and
only ask the user to include somewhere a mention of the source (i.e me or my
Web site). You can use these files as you like (GPL or other).

Cheers,

Thierry

This software contains data files from the rikaichan 1.04 distribution.
The files in question are kanji.dat and radicals.dat.

The original copyright statement is here:

KANJIDIC2
Copyright (C) 2007 The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group
http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/

Basically, rikaichan is using the kanjidic and radkfiles from the Electronic
Dictionary Research and Development Group.  However, they have changed
the format and added quite a few entries.  It is much easier to parse
and more useful.  Also, they are using UTF characters instead of EUC
characters meaning that many more of the proper radicals can be shown.

More licence information can be found in the data/jldrill/COPYING directory in JLDrill’s main distribution.
