JLDrill - Japanese Language Drill program

  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a vocabulary
  drill and a dictionary cross reference tool.

  JLDrill is currently undergoing some change.  At one point I wanted
  it to be a collection of Japanese language drills.  However, I've
  decided to do something different.  After the release of 0.2.0
  I will modify JLDrill to be more of a tool for implementing a
  single method of study.  There will be many parts to the tool but
  they will work together.

  This release just has a few improvements over the 0.1.0.  It is
  extremely useful for doing short term vocabulary acquisition.  It is
  not really appropriate for long term review.  Long term review will
  be top priority for 0.3.0.  If you are looking for a long term
  review aide, I recommend waiting for 0.3.0, or checking out other
  tools like Mnemosyne (http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/).

  WARNING: This is alpha software.  That means that I think it is good
  enough for someone to use and get a benefit out of it.  But it is
  far from finished.  Please report any bugs you find.  Also feel free
  to request features that you would like.

  Other Warning: I haven't tested Windows installation for 0.2.0.  But
  I can't see why it wouldn't work.  Since this is really an interim
  release I would rather work on 0.3.0 than make sure.  Feel free to
  send a bug report if it doesn't work, though.	

Requirements

  * Ruby 1.8
  * GTK+ 2.6 or higher
  * Ruby-Gnome2
  
  JLDrill has been tested on both GNU/Linux (Debian) and Windows.
  If you wish to help create a version of JLDrill to run on a specific
  platform, please contact me.

Install

  First install the prerequisites listed above.  To do so:

  Windows -

    (Note: These instructions haven't been tested yet.  Try them out
     and tell me if they are right!)
 
    You will probably want to install Ruby using the "One Click Ruby
    Installer".   It is available at:

      http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl

    Once that is installed, you will need to install GTK2 and
    Ruby-Gnome2.  Detailed instructions on doing this are available
    at: 
    
	  http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows

    At this point, please follow the common installation instructions
    following the Linux section

  GNU/Linux, BSD, Un*x, etc -

    (Note: These instructions haven't been tested yet.  Try them out
     and tell me if they are right!)
 
	The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
    for your distribution.  However, if you'd rather roll your own
    solution,  You can find Ruby at:
 
      http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

    GTK+ 2.6 at:

      http://www.gtk.org/

    And Ruby-Gnome2 install guides at:

      http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide

    
  Now that you have the prerequisites installed, De-compress the archive
  and enter its top directory.  As root (on Linux, et al) or a user
  with administrative privaledges (on Windows) execute the setup.rb
  script.  It's most useful to do this using a command line shell, but
  you should be able to do it from your graphical file browser as
  well.

  On Linux, et al from bash:

   ($ su)
    # ruby setup.rb

  This simple step installs this program under the default
  location of Ruby libraries.  You can also install files into
  your favorite directory by supplying setup.rb some options.
  Try "ruby setup.rb --help".

  NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: The test facility in setup.rb seems to be broken
  (at least on my machine).  To run the tests, go into the test
  directory and run

    ruby testSuite.rb

  You must install the software first in order to run the tests.

Usage

  Type

    jldrill

  From a command line prompt (sorry it probably won't work from your
  file browser on Windows at the moment).  Many more instructions are
  available on the web page.

  Please see index.html in the web/output directory for usage
  instructions.
