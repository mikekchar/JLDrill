JLDrill - Japanese Language Drill program

  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a vocabulary
  drill, a dictionary cross reference tool and a popup-kanji reference
  (similar to the rikaichan plugin for Firefox).
  
  Installation instructions are available on the website:
  http://jldrill.rubyforge.org
  
  You can also look at all the information for the website in the
  web/output directory.  Start at index.html

  Note: This README file is being deprecated. I'm duplicating
  information that is in the web page.  In the future I'll just
  provide a pointer to the web information.  If you have a strong
  feeling on this matter, please contact me. 

What's New for 0.3.0

  Version 0.3.0 introduces a long-term spaced repetition scheduling
  algorithm.  Please see the document, strategy.txt in the designDoc
  directory.  It is an algorithm of my own devising and still
  needs a bit of teaking.  However, even at this early stage I find
  it is working very well.
  
  Version 0.3.0 also offers numerous user interface improvements.
  There is an indicator box that shows several of the useful Edict
  markers for each vocabulary.  A new option for adding vocabulary
  allows you to add new entries to a quiz (or even build a quiz
  from scratch).  The display of the questions has been improved
  using larger fonts for the kanji.  Finally, if you load the kanji
  dictionary, you can hover over a kanji character and get a
  rikaichan-like popup showing useful information about that character.
  If you install the ttf-kanjistrokeorders font, you will also be shown
  the stroke order of kanji or kana characters.

JLDrill is now Beta   

  I now consider JLDrill to be in beta.  Most of the important features
  are present.  There may still be bugs, but I have been using the
  software myself for several months and I think I've gotten rid
  of most of the big problems.  Please be considerate of the beta status,
  though.  Keep you eyes open for problems and report them.  Poor
  usability issues are especially welcome.  Usability problem reports
  should describe the difficult work flow and give a suggestion for
  a new work flow that will improve the problem.  I am a programmer, not
  a UI desiger, so I welcome any and all advice on this front.
  
TODO

  Version 0.4.0 will be a release version.  That is to say that it
  will be working on the issues needed for a general public release.
  I wish to have a Deb file (possibly RPM as well), and easy
  Windows and OSX installers.  Ideally the Windows and OSX installers
  should be able to install a package that works directly from a
  USB key with no other modifications necessary.  I also want to
  create a basic curriculum for beginner learners of Japanese.
  
License

  JLDrill is licensed under version 3.0 of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
  Please see the COPYING File for more details.  Previous versions of JLDrill
  were released under version 2.0 of the GPL and you may choose that version
  if you wish.  However version 3.0 represents a major improvement in clearing
  up ambiguous details, so I highly recommend choosing GPL 3.0 if you wish to
  extend this software.

Getting Involved

  While I have built JLDrill on the work of others, as an entity on its
  own, I have been the sole contributor.  There are many reasons for this,
  but regardless I am very enthusiastic about receiving any kind of
  contribution from other people.  Even if you can't write software, there
  are many ways you can contribute.  I want to encourage this as much as
  possible.
  
  Please address any comments, suggestions, corrections and patches to:

  I'm also very interested in receiving any new drills you may come up with.
  Please make sure to specify the license information for any material you
  send to me.
