clearing up ambiguous details, so I highly recommend choosing GPL 3.0

== TODO

Please see the TODO.org file.  This file is an Emacs org-mode file.
I started experimenting with it and ended up liking it.  Unfortunately,
the markup is different than rdoc, so the formatting is not that great.
However, one day I'll write an rdoc parser for org-mode files and
everything will be fixed.

== Getting Involved

While I have built JLDrill on the work of others, as an entity on its
own, I have been the sole contributor.  There are many reasons for this,
but regardless I am very enthusiastic about receiving any kind of
contribution from other people.  Even if you can't write software, there
are many ways you can contribute.  I want to encourage this as much as
possible.
  
Please address any comments, suggestions, corrections and patches to:
mailto://mikekchar@gmail.com

I'm also very interested in receiving any new drills you may come up with.
Please make sure to specify the license information for any material you
send to me.
