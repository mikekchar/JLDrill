Japanese language using spaced repetition. 

== Features

* a dictionary cross reference tool 
* pop-up kanji reference (inspired by rikaichan for Firefox)
* ability to import EDICT format files (EUC or UTF8 encoded) as a drill

Current drills include:

* a partial grammar drill derived from 
  {Tae Kim's Japanese Guide to Japanese Grammar}[http://www.guidetojapanese.org]

== TODO

<b>version-0.3.4</b>

* <b>Date Started:</b> December 25th, 2008
* <b>Comleted Jelly Beans:</b> 0
* <b>Total Jelly Beans:</b> 22
* <b>Percentage Complete:</b> 0%

* Add description for ã€… in the kanji popup (<b>estimate:</b> 1 jelly bean)
* Add Ctl-D to load the dictionary from the edit and add windows.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 2 jelly beans)
* Improved workflow for the add window:  When the window comes up,
  the cursor is placed in the Readings box.  If the user presses Ctrl-S,
  the item is searched.  If there are any results, the focus is put
  on the search box.  If not, the focus remains where it is.  When the
  focus is on the search box, up arrow and down arrow will select
  the previous and next items respectively.  Return will insert the
  item and the focus will be placed on the "Add" button.  Another
  keystroke (TBD) will return the focus to the Readings box.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 5 jelly beans)
* Improved workflow for the edit window:  Similar to the add window.
  But when the window first opens, the focus is on the search box
  if there are any entries.  Note: if the user changes items, the
  window does not steal focus, but if possible, the search box should
  have the focus when the window regains focus.  If there are no
  entries in the search box the focus should be on the Readings box.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 3 jelly bean)
* Allow user to modify the global backoff from the options. Must be
  saved with the drill.  When the backoff is changed, all the items
  that are currently scheduled will have to be scaled accordingly.
  For example, if the backoff changes from 2.0 to 1.5, if there
  was an item with a duration of 10, then the duration becomes
  7.5.  If the item had been waiting for 5 days (50% of the duration),
  then reset it so that it has been waiting for 3.75 days (50%
  of 7.5).  Then resort all the items.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 3 jelly beans)
* Renumber item positions when resetting the drill.  This will fix
  problems with old drills that have gotten out of whack.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 1 jelly bean)
* Be able to delete the current item.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 3 jelly beans)
* Be able to delete or edit an item from the "All Vocab" list.
  (<b>estimate:</b> 2 jelly beans)
* Be able to change the order of items in the "All Vocab" list.
  Basically, the user selects an item.  If they press up arrow
  the item will go up.  If they press down arrow, the item will go
  down. (<b>estimate:</b> 2 jelly beans)

<b>Backlog</b>

* Need a mechanism for publishing warnings and errors.
* Full test coverage for all the model objects
* Full test coverage for all the contexts
* Don't steal focus when putting up windows that take no input.  Deferred
  from 0.3.3.  I tried to do it, but it never worked.  I suspect a race
  condition in GTK and it's not important enough to kill myself over.
* Create a recent used menu for loading drills that you've used recently.
* Stop distributing edict in the gem.  Allow the user to set where the
  dictionary is.
* Allow user to set the formatting for each type of data.  Store the
  formatting in the drill.
* Define the structure of the data in the drill.  In other words,
  create a dynamic data type that defines the structure of the data
  item that is to be drilled.  Save it in the drill itself.  Create a
  structure for edict vocabulary.
  * Rename the methods that take Vocabulary (like Quiz#add()) to
    indicate that it's for Vocabulary (i.e., Quiz#addVocab())
* Define a structure for grammar.
* Display parts of speech tags next to what they modify (i.e. each
  definition, or sentence)
* Allow the user to choose what tags to display.  Save this in the drill.
* Associate data items (vocabulary) with the dictionary they belong
  to.  Only load the dictionary if it's in the drill. (Question:
  Should it unload the dictionary on next drill?  Probably yes...)
* Create Debian packaging.
* Create Windows packaging.
* Indicate when the item has been promoted.
* When save fails, indicate it to the user before bringing up the save
  as dialog.
* Replace webgen with something else.  
* Create a dictionary back end to allow it to use online dictionaries,
  or dictionary servers (fantasdic? stardict?)
* Create a structure for Tanaka corpus.
* Create Redhat packaging.
* Create OSX packaging.


== Getting Involved

While I have built JLDrill on the work of others, as an entity on its
own, I have been the sole contributor.  There are many reasons for this,
but regardless I am very enthusiastic about receiving any kind of
contribution from other people.  Even if you can't write software, there
are many ways you can contribute.  I want to encourage this as much as
possible.
  
Please address any comments, suggestions, corrections and patches to:
mailto://mikekchar@gmail.com

I'm also very interested in receiving any new drills you may come up with.
Please make sure to specify the license information for any material you
send to me.
