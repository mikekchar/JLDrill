.SH NAME
jldrill \- Japanese language drill program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jldrill
JLDrill is a program for helping people study and drill various aspects 
of the Japanese language. Current features include a variety of drills
(kana, and vocabulary) a kanji and dictionary reference tool
inspired by the firefox plugin Rikaichan, kanji stroke order
diagrams, and vocabulary collocations using the Tanaka corpus (a
series of example sentences in English and Japanese).  JLDrill's
drills use a spaced repetition algorithm which is unique to it.
This algorithm helps with initial acquisition of vocabulary, automatically
grades item difficulty and improves the ability to deal with inconsistent
review schedules.
