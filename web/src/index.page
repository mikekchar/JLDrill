Welcome to JLDrill
==================
  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a vocabulary
  drill, a dictionary cross reference tool and a popup-kanji reference
  with stroke order diagrams.

What's New for 0.3.0
--------------------
  Version 0.3.0 introduces a long-term spaced repetition scheduling
  algorithm.  Please see the user guide for a description
  of the algorithm used.  It is one of my own devising and still
  needs a bit of teaking.  However, even at this early stage I find
  it at least as useful as the popular SuperMemo algorithms.
  
  Version 0.3.0 also offers numerous user interface improvements.
  There is an indicator box that shows several of the useful Edict
  markers for each vocabulary.  A new option for adding vocabulary
  allows you to add new entries to a quiz (or even build a quiz
  from scratch).  The display of the questions has been improved
  using larger fonts for the kanji.  Finally, if you load the kanji
  dictionary, you can hover over a kanji character and get a
  rikaichan-like popup showing useful information about that character.

JLDrill is now Beta   
-------------------
  I now consider JLDrill to be in beta.  Most of the important features
  are present.  There may still be bugs, but I have been using the
  software myself for several months and I think I've gotten rid
  of most of the big problems.  Please be considerate of the beta status,
  though.  Keep your eyes open for problems and report them.  Poor
  usability issues are especially welcome.  Usability problem reports
  should describe the difficult work flow and give a suggestion for
  a new work flow that will improve the problem.  I am a programmer, not
  a UI desiger, so I welcome any and all advice on this front.

* JLDrill has been under constant development since the last update.
  But I haven't been updating the site.  The reason is that I've
  taken the opportunity to rework the entire code structure.
  There are still plenty of places with embarrasingly bad code,
  but the new structure is there.  Hopefully updates will be
  more frequent

* Added some significant improvements to the CVS version.  If you
  load the dictionary it now warns you if the current item is not
  in the dictionary.  It also displays some of the EDict language
  part indicators.  Finally, the parsing of Edict files has been
  substantially improved.  It now parses tags correctly almost
  all the time.

* お久しぶりね.  What happened here?  No updates for 2 years.
  Well, as it turns out, I wasn't happy with the scheduling algorithm.
  At the time I was just starting to learn about spaced repetition
  and I didn't know how to implement it.  In the end I started
  using Mnemosyne for my daily review.  It took me 2 years to figure
  out what I wanted to do.  Now I'm ready to make some significant
  changes.  

Tuesday, Jan 29 2006.

* New CVS update.  This is a performance improvement for reading the
  edict dictionary.  It should load 2-3x faster now.  Version 0.2.0 is
  a little late (been studying Japanese too much ;-) ).  Expect it in
  the next week or two.

Monday, Dec 19 2005.

* Updated the usage instructions for Windows to better reflect how to
  start the application.  If you were having troubles before, see the
  Usage page.

Saturday, Dec 17 2005.

* Version 0.1.0 is released!  This is the first public release of JLDrill.  

Friday, Dec 16 2005.

* Lots of updates.  All functionality required for the first alpha
release is completed.  Just need to finish the documentation.
Hopefully it will all be done tonight.

Monday, Dec 5 2005.

* New look web page thanks to 
["Webgen"](http://webgen.rubyforge.org)
Yes, it's still ugly (that's not Webgen's fault...).  I thought I'd
get cute with the colours, and well... graphic designer I am not.

* New icon for JLDrill (look to the left of the title)
Umm... see the point above about me not being a graphic designer?  If
you want to help and you don't know how to program, here's your
chance!  I've done the basics, <strong>please</strong> make it not
ugly.
