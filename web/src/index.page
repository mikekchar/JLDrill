Welcome to JLDrill
==================

  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a
  vocabulary drill, a dictionary cross reference tool, a popup-kanji
  reference with stroke order diagrams, example sentences from the
  Tanaka corpus and the ability to do dictionary lookups (with
  deinflection) by hovering the mouse over a word in the quiz or
  examples.

  The current version is 0.5.0.  There is a lot new in this version.
  For a variety of reasons, version 0.4.0 was never publicly released.
  So if you have been used to using version 0.3.0 there is a lot of
  new features.  It will be a good idea to read through the
  documentation to see what you can do.

What's New for 0.5.0
--------------------
  
  The main purpose for 0.5.0 is to add specific functionality to help
  people study Japanese.  Up to this point, most of the functionality
  could be used by a learner of any language.  But the features in
  this version are geared specifically to Japanese.

  The main drill feature is the separation of problem types.  In the
  previous version, JLDrill would present the user with random problem
  types (meaning, kanji, etc).  But in this version, each problem type
  has it's own schedule and you can configure which problem types to
  drill from the options.

  There are two major non-drill changes.  The first is the inclusion
  of the Tanaka corpus into JLDrill.  The Tanaka corpus is a
  collection of almost 200,000 Japanese sentences with English
  translations.  When you drill a word in JLDrill, it can
  automatically look up the example sentences in the Tanaka corpus.

  The other main feature is the ability to search the dictionary by
  kanji.  So if you are entering words in with the Add or Edit dialog,
  you can now simply add the kanji and search for the word.  This is
  especially useful for adding vocabulary by cutting and pasting from
  other documents.

  But in addition to the ability to search by kanji, there is a new
  popup mode that looks up the word under the mouse in the dictionary.
  It also does deinflection, so that verbs that are in past tense, for
  instance are no problem.  The data and algorithm for this feature
  come from the Firefox plugin, Rikaichan and I am very greatful to
  them for it.

  

What's New for 0.4.0
--------------------

  Version 0.4.0 was never publicly released, so for those people who
  were using 0.3.0, here is a list of new features in 0.4.0.

  Version 0.4.0 focuses on ease of use and speed.  While a Windows
  packager was planned, for a variety of reasons it was dropped from
  this version.  This version features a Debian package that can be
  used in Linux distributions that use .deb files (For example Debian
  and Ubuntu).

  New to this version is an updated EDict dictionary.  JLDrill will
  also read EUC files so you may now replace the distributed version
  with new ones without having to change the file to UTF8.  The
  loading of the dictionary is also significantly faster.

  You can now build a new quiz directly from JLDrill.  To that end,
  the Add and Edit windows have had their workflow modified. The All
  Vocab window has also been modified to allow you to modify, preview,
  delete and reorder items in the quiz.

  The scheduling strategy has been dramatically simplified.  The
  system no longer sorts by expected review date.  Instead it sorts by
  the percentage of time the item has gone in it's expected duration.

  Each card can now show a single image using the tag "image:path"
  where the path is the relative path from the quiz to the image.
  Note that you have to escape the / with a \ at the moment.  JLDrill
  will also attempt to automatically resize the panes to fit larger
  problems.

  Various other bug fixes and small improvements to the scheduling
  strategy have also been implemented.

JLDrill is Beta Software   
------------------------

  I consider JLDrill to be in beta.  Most of the important features
  are present.  There may still be bugs, but I have been using the
  software myself for several years and I think I've gotten rid
  of most of the big problems.  Please be considerate of the beta status,
  though.  Keep your eyes open for problems and report them.  Poor
  usability issues are especially welcome.  Usability problem reports
  should describe the difficult work flow and give a suggestion for
  a new work flow that will improve the problem.  I am a programmer, not
  a UI designer, so I welcome any and all advice on this front.

* I spent far more time than I expected getting this version out.
  My apologies.  While I am reasonably consistent writing code,
  I am less consistent releasing versions.  I have made some
  process changes and have enlisted some help.  More news soon! 

Thursday, August 26 2010.

* Development version 0.4.1 released.  To be honest I haven't gotten
  around to putting up 0.4.0 anywhere, so nobody has tried it. But
  the new development release makes some drastic changes to the
  scheduler.  It also allows you to choose what kind of problems
  you want to be drilled with.  Finally, it reviews problems
  types independently (for example, Meaning and Kanji problems
  are both scheduled for review for each item).  Sorry for the
  slow releases.  I have been putting more time in on studying
  and less on programming.

Friday, March 15 2010

* Version 0.4.0 released.  I didn't finish the features I planned
  to, but sometimes you just have to draw a line in the sand and
  release.  Especially since it's been more than a year since
  the previous release.

Thursday, October 8 2009.

* Because I kept fiddling with the code I'm making a 0.3.5 development
  version.  Really, I should have released 0.4.0, but I'm too lazy.
  This version simplifies the user's view of scheduling.  It also
  dispenses with the concept of getting "behind".

Friday, April 3 2009.

* Development version 0.3.4 released.  This is the release candidate.
If I don't find any major problems, this will become 0.4.0.  For
a variety of reasons it actually focuses on speed, a new dictionary
and the ability to create and edit new drills.  Packaging has been
pushed back (again).

Thursday, Dec 25 2008.

* Development version 0.3.3 released.  In case you thought you didn't
  see the other versions, don't worry.  They didn't actually make it
  on to the server.  Distributed source management is great if you
  actually remember to do a push once in a while...

Friday, Dec 19 2008.

* Development version 0.3.2 released.

Saturday, Dec 13 2008.

* Added links to the download page to make installation easier.  Added
  a page on Development which links to my bzr repositories since I no
  longer keep the source on Rubyforge.

Tuesday, Dec 9 2008.

* Release day for 0.3.0.  It's taken much longer than I expected to
  get to this point.  In fact, there's been a freeze for the most part
  since September, but I haven't even been able to find time to
  update the web page.  But now going into winter break I should
  have some time.


Friday, Aug 29 2008.

* JLDrill has been under constant development since the last update.
  But I haven't been updating the site.  The reason is that I've
  taken the opportunity to rework the entire code structure.
  There are still plenty of places with embarrassingly bad code,
  but the new structure is there.  Hopefully updates will be
  more frequent

Sunday, Nov 11 2007.

* Added some significant improvements to the CVS version.  If you
  load the dictionary it now warns you if the current item is not
  in the dictionary.  It also displays some of the EDict language
  part indicators.  Finally, the parsing of Edict files has been
  substantially improved.  It now parses tags correctly almost
  all the time.

Friday, Nov 2 2007.

* お久しぶりね.  What happened here?  No updates for 2 years.
  Well, as it turns out, I wasn't happy with the scheduling algorithm.
  At the time I was just starting to learn about spaced repetition
  and I didn't know how to implement it.  In the end I started
  using Mnemosyne for my daily review.  It took me 2 years to figure
  out what I wanted to do.  Now I'm ready to make some significant
  changes.  

Tuesday, Jan 29 2006.

* New CVS update.  This is a performance improvement for reading the
  edict dictionary.  It should load 2-3x faster now.  Version 0.2.0 is
  a little late (been studying Japanese too much ;-) ).  Expect it in
  the next week or two.

Monday, Dec 19 2005.

* Updated the usage instructions for Windows to better reflect how to
  start the application.  If you were having troubles before, see the
  Usage page.

Saturday, Dec 17 2005.

* Version 0.1.0 is released!  This is the first public release of JLDrill.  

Friday, Dec 16 2005.

* Lots of updates.  All functionality required for the first alpha
release is completed.  Just need to finish the documentation.
Hopefully it will all be done tonight.

Monday, Dec 5 2005.

* New look web page thanks to 
["Webgen"](http://webgen.rubyforge.org)
Yes, it's still ugly (that's not Webgen's fault...).  I thought I'd
get cute with the colours, and well... graphic designer I am not.

* New icon for JLDrill (look to the left of the title)
Umm... see the point above about me not being a graphic designer?  If
you want to help and you don't know how to program, here's your
chance!  I've done the basics, <strong>please</strong> make it not
ugly.
