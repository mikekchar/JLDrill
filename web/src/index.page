Welcome to JLDrill
==================
  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a vocabulary
  drill, a dictionary cross reference tool and a popup-kanji reference
  with stroke order diagrams.

What's New for 0.4.0
--------------------

  Version 0.4.0 focusses on ease of use and speed.  While a Windows
  packager was planned, for a variety of reasons it was dropped
  from this version.  Hopefully it will find its way back for version
  0.5.0.  But this version features a Debian package that can be
  used in Linux distributions that use .deb files (For example
  Debian and Ubuntu).

  New to this version is an updated EDict dictionary.  JLDrill
  will also read EUC files so you may now replace the distributed
  version with new ones without having to change the file to UTF8.
  The loading of the dictionary is also significantly faster.

  You can now build a new quiz directly from JLDrill.  To that
  end, the Add and Edit windows have had their workflow modified. The All
  Vocab window has also been modified to allow you to modify, preview, 
  delete and reorder items in the quiz.

  The scheduling strategy has been improved.  Previously if you
  reviewed slower than expected, or if you neglected your studying,
  you could fall "behind".  This concept has now been removed
  from the software, since there is no real schedule per se.  Instead
  the software will try to maintain a 90% success rate in your
  reviews.  This should reduce the need for the "Review" button.

  Various other bug fixes and small improvements to the scheduling strategy
  have also been implemented.

JLDrill is Beta Software   
------------------------
  I consider JLDrill to be in beta.  Most of the important features
  are present.  There may still be bugs, but I have been using the
  software myself for several yearss and I think I've gotten rid
  of most of the big problems.  Please be considerate of the beta status,
  though.  Keep your eyes open for problems and report them.  Poor
  usability issues are especially welcome.  Usability problem reports
  should describe the difficult work flow and give a suggestion for
  a new work flow that will improve the problem.  I am a programmer, not
  a UI desiger, so I welcome any and all advice on this front.

Thursday, October 8 2009.

* Because I kept fiddling with the code I'm making a 0.3.5 development
  version.  Really, I should have released 0.4.0, but I'm too lazy.
  This version simplifies the user's view of scheduling.  It also
  dispenses with the concept of getting "behind".

Friday, April 3 2009.

* Development version 0.3.4 released.  This is the release candidate.
If I don't find any major problems, this will become 0.4.0.  For
a variety of reasons it actually focuses on speed, a new dictionary
and the ability to create and edit new drills.  Packaging has been
pushed back (again).

Thursday, Dec 25 2008.

* Development version 0.3.3 released.  In case you thought you didn't
  see the other versions, don't worry.  They didn't actually make it
  on to the server.  Distributed source management is great if you
  actually remember to do a push once in a while...

Friday, Dec 19 2008.

* Development version 0.3.2 released.

Saturday, Dec 13 2008.

* Added links to the download page to make installation easier.  Added
  a page on Development which links to my bzr repositories since I no
  longer keep the source on Rubyforge.

Tuesday, Dec 9 2008.

* Release day for 0.3.0.  It's taken much longer than I expected to
  get to this point.  In fact, there's been a freeze for the most part
  since September, but I haven't even been able to find time to
  update the web page.  But now going into winter break I should
  have some time.


Friday, Aug 29 2008.

* JLDrill has been under constant development since the last update.
  But I haven't been updating the site.  The reason is that I've
  taken the opportunity to rework the entire code structure.
  There are still plenty of places with embarrasingly bad code,
  but the new structure is there.  Hopefully updates will be
  more frequent

Sunday, Nov 11 2007.

* Added some significant improvements to the CVS version.  If you
  load the dictionary it now warns you if the current item is not
  in the dictionary.  It also displays some of the EDict language
  part indicators.  Finally, the parsing of Edict files has been
  substantially improved.  It now parses tags correctly almost
  all the time.

Friday, Nov 2 2007.

* お久しぶりね.  What happened here?  No updates for 2 years.
  Well, as it turns out, I wasn't happy with the scheduling algorithm.
  At the time I was just starting to learn about spaced repetition
  and I didn't know how to implement it.  In the end I started
  using Mnemosyne for my daily review.  It took me 2 years to figure
  out what I wanted to do.  Now I'm ready to make some significant
  changes.  

Tuesday, Jan 29 2006.

* New CVS update.  This is a performance improvement for reading the
  edict dictionary.  It should load 2-3x faster now.  Version 0.2.0 is
  a little late (been studying Japanese too much ;-) ).  Expect it in
  the next week or two.

Monday, Dec 19 2005.

* Updated the usage instructions for Windows to better reflect how to
  start the application.  If you were having troubles before, see the
  Usage page.

Saturday, Dec 17 2005.

* Version 0.1.0 is released!  This is the first public release of JLDrill.  

Friday, Dec 16 2005.

* Lots of updates.  All functionality required for the first alpha
release is completed.  Just need to finish the documentation.
Hopefully it will all be done tonight.

Monday, Dec 5 2005.

* New look web page thanks to 
["Webgen"](http://webgen.rubyforge.org)
Yes, it's still ugly (that's not Webgen's fault...).  I thought I'd
get cute with the colours, and well... graphic designer I am not.

* New icon for JLDrill (look to the left of the title)
Umm... see the point above about me not being a graphic designer?  If
you want to help and you don't know how to program, here's your
chance!  I've done the basics, <strong>please</strong> make it not
ugly.
