Welcome to JLDrill
==================

  JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
  Japanese and Chinese languages. Current features include a kana drill, a
  vocabulary drill, a dictionary cross reference tool, a popup
  reference with stroke order diagrams for kanji and traditional 
  chinese characters, example sentences from the
  Tatoeba database and the ability to do dictionary lookups (with
  deinflection in Japanese) by hovering the mouse over a word in the quiz or
  examples.

  NEW IN 0.5.2! Mandarin language support using the CC-CEdict dictionary
  and Tatoeba example sentences.  The popup kanji tool will display
  readings for Mandarin Chinese.  Unfortunately, the stroke order font
  only supports tranditional characters.

  The current version is 0.5.2.

What's New for 0.5.2
--------------------

  As seen above, the big feature for 0.5.2 is support for drilling
  Mandarin Chinese.  Both traditional and simplified characters are
  supported in the dictionary tool, but unfortunately the kanji
  popup mostly only supports traditional characters (if you search
  for a simplified character, it will give the the radical information
  for the traditional equivalent).  The stroke order font also
  only supports traditional characters (if you know of a similar
  font for simplified characters, please contact me).

  The other big feature for this release is Ruby 1.9 support.
  As far as I know, it will work on any 1.9 version supported by
  ruby-gtk.

  I have also transitioned away from the Tanaka corpus as the source
  of example sentences.  The project is now maintained by the
  Tatoeba project and since I needed to use Tatoeba for Chinese
  example sentences, it was a good time to switch.  There is no
  loss of functionality, but because the database contains a lot
  more information, loading is slower.  In the next release I will
  try to rectify that problem.

  The statistics window has been given a new tab for forgotten items.
  If you are used to getting behind (like me), you might appreciate it.
  Basically, the statistics in the forgotten tab work just like
  the statistics for items in the review set, but for forgotten items.

  One last major issue is the introduction of a folder for containing
  your own personal dictionaries and such.  If you create a folder
  called ".jldrill" in your home directory and put a file structure
  the same as the distributed data directory (.jldrill/quiz for your
  drill files, .jldrill/dict for dictionary files, etc), you can
  overload the installed versions.  This is useful for having your
  drill files show up right away when opening a file, for example.
  It is also especially useful for overriding the very old edict
  dictionary that is distributed with Debian based distributions
  (just put a newer version of edict in .jldrill/dict).

JLDrill is Beta Software   
------------------------

  I consider JLDrill to be in beta.  Most of the important features
  are present.  There may still be bugs, but I have been using the
  software myself for several years and I think I've gotten rid
  of most of the big problems.  Please be considerate of the beta status,
  though.  Keep your eyes open for problems and report them.  Poor
  usability issues are especially welcome.  Usability problem reports
  should describe the difficult work flow and give a suggestion for
  a new work flow that will improve the problem.  I am a programmer, not
  a UI designer, so I welcome any and all advice on this front.

* Release 0.5.2.  Wow! Almost a year between minor releases!  Sorry about
that.  I have been working on other projects in the meantime.  But it
was time to give JLDrill a little bit of love.

Monday, May 23 2011

* Release 0.5.1

Wednesday, March  9 2011

* Getting ready for the 0.5.1 release.

Monday, January 17 2011

* I spent far more time than I expected getting this version out.
  My apologies.  While I am reasonably consistent writing code,
  I am less consistent releasing versions.  I have made some
  process changes and have enlisted some help.  More news soon! 

Thursday, August 26 2010.

* Development version 0.4.1 released.  To be honest I haven't gotten
  around to putting up 0.4.0 anywhere, so nobody has tried it. But
  the new development release makes some drastic changes to the
  scheduler.  It also allows you to choose what kind of problems
  you want to be drilled with.  Finally, it reviews problems
  types independently (for example, Meaning and Kanji problems
  are both scheduled for review for each item).  Sorry for the
  slow releases.  I have been putting more time in on studying
  and less on programming.

Friday, March 15 2010

* Version 0.4.0 released.  I didn't finish the features I planned
  to, but sometimes you just have to draw a line in the sand and
  release.  Especially since it's been more than a year since
  the previous release.

Thursday, October 8 2009.

* Because I kept fiddling with the code I'm making a 0.3.5 development
  version.  Really, I should have released 0.4.0, but I'm too lazy.
  This version simplifies the user's view of scheduling.  It also
  dispenses with the concept of getting "behind".

Friday, April 3 2009.

* Development version 0.3.4 released.  This is the release candidate.
  If I don't find any major problems, this will become 0.4.0.  For
  a variety of reasons it actually focuses on speed, a new dictionary
  and the ability to create and edit new drills.  Packaging has been
  pushed back (again).

Thursday, Dec 25 2008.

* Development version 0.3.3 released.  In case you thought you didn't
  see the other versions, don't worry.  They didn't actually make it
  on to the server.  Distributed source management is great if you
  actually remember to do a push once in a while...

Friday, Dec 19 2008.

* Development version 0.3.2 released.

Saturday, Dec 13 2008.

* Added links to the download page to make installation easier.  Added
  a page on Development which links to my bzr repositories since I no
  longer keep the source on Rubyforge.

Tuesday, Dec 9 2008.

* Release day for 0.3.0.  It's taken much longer than I expected to
  get to this point.  In fact, there's been a freeze for the most part
  since September, but I haven't even been able to find time to
  update the web page.  But now going into winter break I should
  have some time.


Friday, Aug 29 2008.

* JLDrill has been under constant development since the last update.
  But I haven't been updating the site.  The reason is that I've
  taken the opportunity to rework the entire code structure.
  There are still plenty of places with embarrassingly bad code,
  but the new structure is there.  Hopefully updates will be
  more frequent

Sunday, Nov 11 2007.

* Added some significant improvements to the CVS version.  If you
  load the dictionary it now warns you if the current item is not
  in the dictionary.  It also displays some of the EDict language
  part indicators.  Finally, the parsing of Edict files has been
  substantially improved.  It now parses tags correctly almost
  all the time.

Friday, Nov 2 2007.

* お久しぶりね.  What happened here?  No updates for 2 years.
  Well, as it turns out, I wasn't happy with the scheduling algorithm.
  At the time I was just starting to learn about spaced repetition
  and I didn't know how to implement it.  In the end I started
  using Mnemosyne for my daily review.  It took me 2 years to figure
  out what I wanted to do.  Now I'm ready to make some significant
  changes.  

Tuesday, Jan 29 2006.

* New CVS update.  This is a performance improvement for reading the
  edict dictionary.  It should load 2-3x faster now.  Version 0.2.0 is
  a little late (been studying Japanese too much ;-) ).  Expect it in
  the next week or two.

Monday, Dec 19 2005.

* Updated the usage instructions for Windows to better reflect how to
  start the application.  If you were having troubles before, see the
  Usage page.

Saturday, Dec 17 2005.

* Version 0.1.0 is released!  This is the first public release of JLDrill.  

Friday, Dec 16 2005.

* Lots of updates.  All functionality required for the first alpha
  release is completed.  Just need to finish the documentation.
  Hopefully it will all be done tonight.

Monday, Dec 5 2005.

* New look web page thanks to ["Webgen"](http://webgen.rubyforge.org)
  Yes, it's still ugly (that's not Webgen's fault...).  I thought I'd
  get cute with the colours, and well... graphic designer I am not.

* New icon for JLDrill (look to the left of the title)
  Umm... see the point above about me not being a graphic designer?  If
  you want to help and you don't know how to program, here's your
  chance!  I've done the basics, <strong>please</strong> make it not
  ugly.
