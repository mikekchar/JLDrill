h2. Welcome to JLDrill

JLDrill is a program for helping people drill various aspects of the
Japanese language. Current features include a kana drill, a vocabulary
drill and a dictionary cross reference tool.  The current version
is only useful for short term acquisition.  It does not have a
proper scheduling algorithm for long term retention.

I have changed the scope of JLDrill since the last time I was working
on it.  Originally it was to be a collection of Japanese language
drill.  Now, after 2 years of playing with other software I have
a better idea of what I find useful.  Subsequent releases of JLDrill
will be geared towards creating one particular solution for helping
people learn Japanese.

This is what the application looks like right now.

WARNING: This is alpha software.  That means that I think it is good
enough for someone to use and get a benefit out of it.  But it is
far from finished.  Please report any bugs you find.  Also feel free
to request features that you would like.

NOTE: JLDrill will be undergoing some significant changes in the
near future (see news).  Check back later to see what's up.


h2. News

Sunday, Nov 11 2007.

* Added some significant improvements to the CVS version.  If you
  load the dictionary it now warns you if the current item is not
  in the dictionary.  It also displays some of the EDict language
  part indicators.  Finally, the parsing of Edict files has been
  substantially improved.  It now parses tags correctly almost
  all the time.

* お久しぶりね.  What happened here?  No updates for 2 years.
  Well, as it turns out, I wasn't happy with the scheduling algorithm.
  At the time I was just starting to learn about spaced repetition
  and I didn't know how to implement it.  In the end I started
  using Mnemosyne for my daily review.  It took me 2 years to figure
  out what I wanted to do.  Now I'm ready to make some significant
  changes.

* New CVS update.  This is a performance improvement for reading the
  edict dictionary.  It should load 2-3x faster now.  Version 0.2.0 is
  a little late (been studying Japanese too much ;-) ).  Expect it in
  the next week or two.

Monday, Dec 19 2005.

* Updated the usage instructions for Windows to better reflect how to
  start the application.  If you were having troubles before, see the
  Usage page.

Saturday, Dec 17 2005.

* Version 0.1.0 is released!  This is the first public release of JLDrill.  

Friday, Dec 16 2005.

* Lots of updates.  All functionality required for the first alpha
release is completed.  Just need to finish the documentation.
Hopefully it will all be done tonight.

* New look web page thanks to "Webgen":http://webgen.rubyforge.org
Yes, it's still ugly (that's not Webgen's fault...).  I thought I'd
get cute with the colours, and well... graphic designer I am not.

* New icon for JLDrill (look to the left of the title)
Umm... see the point above about me not being a graphic designer?  If
you want to help and you don't know how to program, here's your
chance!  I've done the basics, <strong>please</strong> make it not
ugly.
