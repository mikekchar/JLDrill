Installation Instructions
=========================

Download
--------

The current stable release of JLDrill is 0.5.0.  It can be obtained at
[JLDrill's RubyForge Project Page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/jldrill).

There are 3 methods to run JLDrill

###Debian Based Systems

Please download and install the following files

UPDATE ME!!!
* [context-0.0.21.deb](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48213/context-0.0.20.deb)
* [jldrill-0.5.0.deb](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48212/jldrill-0.4.0.deb)

This is all you will need.

### Gems

For every other system that doesn't use deb files (including Windows) you can install
the application using gem files.

You will need the following files:

UPDATE ME!!!
* [context-0.0.21.gem](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48213/context-0.0.20.gem)
* [jldrill-0.5.0.gem](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48212/jldrill-0.4.0.gem)

and optionally

* [KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48214/KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf)
* [kochi-mincho.ttf](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48217/kochi-mincho.ttf)

Of the two optional fonts, the KanjiStrokeOrders is most important.  It
allows you to see the stroke orders.  The kochi-mincho font is the
font that the application defaults to when quizzing kanji and readings.
It is not necessary if you already have a Japanese font.

### In place execution

JLDrill will also run directly from the development tree.  You can download
the development tree from:

[jldrill-0.4.2](http://sakabatou.dnsdojo.org/devel/jldrill/jldrill-0.4.2)

From there the application can be run by navigating to the directory and running
AppRun.  You may want to install the fonts listed above in the gem section
(see below)

Installing Gems
---------------
First ensure that you have the [requirements](Requirements.html) installed.

From a command line prompt (Start->Applications->Accessories->Command
in Windows), type the following:

<pre>
    gem install context-0.0.21.gem
    gem install jldrill-0.5.0.gem
</pre>

Note: Depending on how you installed ruby gems, you may have to be root or use 
sudo in Linux.

JLDrill is now installed.  However, in order to view the stroke order diagrams,
you must install the stroke order font.

Installing the Fonts
--------------------
###Windows
In Windows you must download the fonts (KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf and/or
kochi-mincho.ttf) files and copy them into the
font directory.  You can get the font directory by selecting 
Start->Control Panel->Fonts.

There is one more thing you must do.  Unfortunately Windows
doesn't follow it's own specification for fonts, so the KanjiStrokeOrders
font looks terrible.  In some cases you can barely read the stroke number.
In order to get the sub-pixel hints you must turn on Clear-Type.  You
can do so by right clicking on the desktop.  Then select Properties.  From
the window, select the Appearance tab.  Press the "Effects..." button.
The second entry has a checkbox and reads "Use the following method to 
smooth the edges of screen fonts:".  Check this button and select "Clear Type"
from the following drop down menu.

This will have the effect of turning on anti-aliasing for all your fonts.
Some people don't like this as it makes your characters a bit blurry.  However,
I find that the smoothing effect is more desirable.

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc
On a Debian based system (which includes Ubuntu), you can install the 
ttf-kanjistrokeorders and ttf-kochi-mincho packages.  (Note:
ttf-kanjistrokeorders is not available in the standard Ubuntu packages.
You will have to enable the Universe repository)  

On other systems you will have to have a font system installed that handles
true type fonts, like XFS.  If you have XFS installed, 
[here](http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/Installing_TrueType_Fonts_with_xfs.html)
is an explanation on how to install the font.
