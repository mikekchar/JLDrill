h2. Installation Instructions

The current stable release of JLDrill is 0.1.0.

It can be obtained at
"JLDrill's RubyForge Project Page":http://rubyforge.org/projects/jldrill 

Once you have downloaded the package, decompress it.  Then as root (on
Linux, et al) or a user with administrative privaledges (on Windows)
execute the setup.rb script.  It's most useful to do this using a
command line shell, but you should be able to do it from your
graphical file browser as well.

Go into the top directory.  Then type:
<pre>
 ($ su)
  # ruby setup.rb
</pre>

This simple step installs this program under the default
location of Ruby libraries.  You can also install files into
your favorite directory by supplying setup.rb some options.
Try 

<pre>
  ruby setup.rb --help
</pre>

NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: The test facility in setup.rb seems to be broken
(at least on my machine).  To run the tests, go into the test
directory and run 
<pre> 
  ruby testSuite.rb 
</pre> 

You must install the software in order to run the tests.

Please see the Usage page for instructions on how to run the software.
