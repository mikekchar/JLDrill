Installation Instructions
=========================

Download
--------

The current stable release of JLDrill is 0.6.0.  It can be obtained at
[JLDrill's RubyForge Project Page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/jldrill).

There are 3 methods to run JLDrill

###Debian Based Systems

Please download and install the following files

* [jldrill-0.6.0.deb](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74902/jldrill_0.6.0-1_all.deb)

This is all you will need.

### Gems

For every other system that doesn't use deb files (including Windows)
you can install the application using gem files.  The easiest
way to do this is simply go to your command line
(from Windows: Start->Programs->Accessories->Command) 
and type:
<pre>
    gem install jldrill
</pre>

This will automatically download and install the latest version of
JLDrill from the internet.  It will also install ruby-gnome2,
and on Windows the gnome libraries as well.  Please be patient
because it can take a long time to download.  You can use
JLDrill as it is, but probably you will want to install the
stroke order font for showing the stroke order of kanji
characters.

The main website for the font is at [nihilistorguk](http://sites.google.com/site/nihilistorguk/).  I recommend downloading the latest one there (it's the first link on the page).  If, for some reason, you have trouble getting to that page, you can also download an old version of the font here:

* [Old version of KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/48214/KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf)

If you are updating from a previous version of jldrill, you can
type:
<pre>
    gem update jldrill
</pre>

Note: jldrill used to depend on the context gem.  These two gems
are now merged.  If you have installed a version prior to 0.5.1,
you should remove context with:
<pre>
    gem uninstall context
</pre>

If you wish to download the gems for jldrill by hand for some reason,
they are located here.  Context is a library used by jldrill.

* [jldrill-0.6.0.gem](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74901/jldrill-0.6.0.1.gem)

### In place execution

JLDrill will also run directly from the development tree.  You can download
the development tree from github:

[jldrill-0.6.0](https://github.com/mikekchar/JLDrill)

git is a source code management system.  If you are new to github, you
can get help by pressing the help button at the top of the linked page.

After you download the code the application can be run by navigating to the directory and running
AppRun.  You may want to install the font listed above in the gem section
(see below)

Installing the Font
--------------------
It is useful to install the KanjiStrokeOrders font in order to see
the stroke order for Kanji characters.

###Windows
In Windows you must download KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf and copy it into the
font directory.  You can get the font directory by selecting 
Start->Control Panel->Fonts.

There is one more thing you must do.  Unfortunately Windows XP
doesn't follow it's own specification for fonts, so the KanjiStrokeOrders
font looks terrible.  In some cases you can barely read the stroke number.
In order to get the sub-pixel hints you must turn on Clear-Type.  You
can do so by right clicking on the desktop.  Then select Properties.  From
the window, select the Appearance tab.  Press the "Effects..." button.
The second entry has a checkbox and reads "Use the following method to 
smooth the edges of screen fonts:".  Check this button and select "Clear Type"
from the following drop down menu.

This will have the effect of turning on anti-aliasing for all your fonts.
Some people don't like this as it makes your characters a bit blurry.  However,
I find that the smoothing effect is more desirable.

Windows 7 doesn't seem to have this problem, so if you are using
a recent version of Windows, you shouldn't have to do anything. 

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc
On a Debian based system (which includes Ubuntu), you can install the 
ttf-kanjistrokeorders and ttf-kochi-mincho packages.  (Note:
ttf-kanjistrokeorders is not available in the standard Ubuntu packages.
You will have to enable the Universe repository)  

On other systems you will have to have a font system installed that handles
true type fonts, like XFS.  If you have XFS installed, 
[here](http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/Installing_TrueType_Fonts_with_xfs.html)
is an explanation on how to install the font.
