Installation Instructions
=========================

Download
--------
The current stable release of JLDrill is 0.3.0.  It can be obtained at
[JLDrill's RubyForge Project Page](http://rubyforge.org/projects/jldrill).
You will need the following files:

<pre>
    context-0.0.16.gem
    jldrill-0.3.0.gem
</pre>

and optionally

<pre>
    KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf
</pre>

TODO: Add links for the files.

Important Note:
---------------
Version 0.3.0 does not have an easy to use installer.  This
is planned for version 0.4.0.  I apologize for this, but
infortunately functionality issues had priority for the
current version.  Installation is complicated at the present
time, but not necessarily difficult.  If you have problems,
feel free to contact me and I will try to help.


Installation
------------
First ensure that you have the [requirements](Requirements.html) installed.

From a command line prompt (Start->Applications->Accessories->Command
in Windows), type the following:

<pre>
    gem install context-0.0.16.gem
    gem install jldrill-0.3.0.gem
</pre>

Note: You will have to be root or use sudo in Linux.

JLDrill is now installed.  However, in order to view the stroke order diagrams,
you must install the stroke order font.  

Installing the Stroke Order Font
--------------------------------
On a Debian based system (and Ubuntu), you can install the ttf-kanjistrokeorders
package.  TODO: Write a description for how to install the font on other
systems.

In Windows you must download the KanjiStrokeOrders.ttf file and copy it into the
font directory.  You can get the font directory by selecting Start->Control Panel->Fonts.

On Windows there is one more thing you must do.  Unfortunately Windows
doesn't follow it's own specification for fonts, so the KanjiStrokeOrders
font looks terrible.  In some cases you can barely read the stroke number.
In order to get the sub-pixel hints you must turn on Clear-Type.  You
can do so by right clicking on the desktop.  Then select Properties.  From
the window, select the Appearance tab.  Press the "Effects..." button.
The second entry has a checkbox and reads "Use the following method to 
smooth the edges of screen fonts:".  Check this button and select "Clear Type"
from the following drop down menu.

This will have the effect of turning on anti-aliasing for all your fonts.
Some people don't like this as it makes your characters a bit blurry.  However,
I find that the smoothing effect is more desirable.
