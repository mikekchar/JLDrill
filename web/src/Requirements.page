JLDrill Requirements
====================

Important Note:
---------------
JLDrill is easiest to install on a GNU/Linux system using Debian
based packages (for example Debian or Ubuntu).  If you have such a
system, you can skip this section an move to the [Install](Install.html)
 section.  Otherwise read on.

What to Install
---------------
JLDrill is written in Ruby and uses GTK2 as it's GUI toolkit.  You
will need to install the following before installing JLDrill.

* Ruby 1.8 (Version 1.8.7 or higher)
* rubygems
* GTK+ 2.6 or higher
* Ruby-Gnome2 0.16 or higher

Note: Ruby 1.9 does *not* work!!

JLDrill has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).
It should work on any platform that supports Ruby, Gtk and Ruby-Gnome
(including Windows and Apple-Macintosh).

Installing the Requirements
---------------------------
There are different requirements depending on the system you use.

###Windows

The installation of the requirements for Windows is not very complicated.
Unfortunately they are rather large downloads and install a lot of things
that you won't need just to run JLDrill.  If demand warrants, I will make
a more streamlined package for Windows.  Please contact me if you are
using JLDrill on Windows.

The best place to get Ruby is the official Ruby website.  You must
install
[Ruby version 1.8.7](http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/72085/rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p302.exe).  Note that only version 1.8.7 or higher will work.
Also, version 1.9.x will not work at the current time.

You are now ready to install JLDrill.  For the next step you will
need an internet connection, though.  Please see the
[Download/Install](Install.html) section for details on obtaining and 
installing JLDrill.

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc

The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
for your distribution.  I have tested everything with the packages
available from Debian and Ubuntu.  You currently have 2 options for
installing JLDrill from packages.  The first is using a debian package
install.  If you are doing this then there is nothing you need to
prepare.  The second option is install using gems.  If you are doing
this then you must install Ruby and Ruby gems.

Note: The Debian and Ubuntu package for rubygems puts the gems
in /var/lib/gems/1.8.  In order to be able to run JLDrill you need to
add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin in your path.  I have added
<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
export RUBYOPT=rubygems
</pre>
to the end of my .bashrc file.

Note that the Debian packages and gem packages are not compatible.
Specifically, if you install ruby-gnome2 from the Debian packages,
you can not install jldrill from the gem packages.  This is
unfortunate but there is nothing I can do about it.

If you'd rather roll your own solution for installation,  You can find Ruby at the 
[main Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  Please note: The
gnome-gtk bindings do *not* work with Ruby 1.9.  You will have to install
Ruby 1.8.

Now you need to install RubyGems.  You can find documentation on doing that
at the [RubyGems website](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3).

GTK+ 2.6 can be obtained at the [GTK+ website](http://www.gtk.org/)

Finally, you will want to follow the
[Ruby-Gnome2 install guides](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide)

Please see the Download/Install section for details on obtaining and
installing JLDrill

###Mac OSX
Unfortunately I don't have access to a Macintosh.  It should be
possible to install JLDrill on a Macintosh using the gem packages,
and tell me if it works.  Unfortunately JLDrill requires Ruby 1.8.7.
From the Ruby website it seems that only 1.8.6 is officially
supported, and 1.8.2 is included in Tiger.  This may mean that
JLDrill is impossible to install at this time.  I will try to
get more information some time.

Assuming you can get Ruby 1.8.7 installed, you must also install
Gnome.  This is apparently available at [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/)
but I am afraid I don't know the details.

Finally, you should be able to simply go to the instructions
for installing the jldrill gems. It will build ruby-gnome2
in the process.

If you manage to do this, please contact me so I can put better
instructions here.
