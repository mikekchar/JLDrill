JLDrill Requirements
====================

Important Note:
---------------
JLDrill is easiest to install on a GNU/Linux system using Debian
based packages (for example Debian or Ubuntu).  If you have such a
system, you can skip this section an move to the [Install](Install.html)
 section.  Otherwise read on.

What to Install
---------------
JLDrill is written in Ruby and uses GTK2 as it's GUI toolkit.  You
will need to install the following before installing JLDrill.

* Ruby 1.8 (Ruby 1.9 currently does *not* work!)
* rubygems
* GTK+ 2.6 or higher
* Ruby-Gnome2 0.16 or higer

JLDrill has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).
It should work on any platform that supports Ruby, Gtk and Ruby-Gnome
(including Windows and Apple-Macintosh).

Installing the Requirements
---------------------------

###Windows

The installation of the requirements for Windows is not very complicated.
Unfortunately they are rather large downloads and install a lot of things
that you won't need just to run JLDrill.  If demand warrants, I will make
a more streamlined package for Windows.  Please contact me if you are
using JLDrill on Windows.

You will probably want to install Ruby using the 
[One Click Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl).
This is very convenient because it also installs rubygems and puts everything
in your path.

Once that is installed, you will need to install GTK2 and
Ruby-Gnome2.  Detailed instructions on doing this are available
on the [Ruby-Gnome2 site](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows).
Again, the installation is rather simple and it installs the GTK2
libraries at the same time as the ruby-gnome libraries.

You are now finished installing the requirements.  Please see the
[Download/Install](Install.html) section for details on obtaining and 
installing JLDrill.

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc

The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
for your distribution.  I have tested everything with the packages
available from Debian and Ubuntu (Hardy Heron).  

Note: The Debian and Ubuntu package for rubygems puts the gems
in /var/lib/gems/1.8.  In order to be able to run JLDrill you need to
add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin in your path.  I have added
<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
export RUBYOPT=rubygems
</pre>
to the end of my .bashrc file.

If you'd rather roll your own solution for installation,  You can find Ruby at the 
[main Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  Please note: The
gnome-gtk bindings do *not* work with Ruby 1.9.  You will have to install
Ruby 1.8.

Now you need to install RubyGems.  You can find documentation on doing that
at the [RubyGems website](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3).

GTK+ 2.6 can be obtained at the [GTK+ website](http://www.gtk.org/)

Finally, you will want to follow the
[Ruby-Gnome2 install guides](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide)

Please see the Download/Install section for details on obtaining and
installing JLDrill

###Mac OSX
Unfortunately I don't have access to a Macintosh.  Installation of
GTK+ and ruby-gnome is difficult and requires a developer level of
knowledge.  If there is anyone with OSX who wants to work on an
easy way to install this, please contact me.
