JLDrill Requirements
====================

Important Note:
---------------
Version 0.3.0 does not have an easy to use installer.  This
is planned for version 0.4.0.  I apologize for this, but
infortunately functionality issues had priority for the
current version.  Installation is complicated at the present
time, but not necessarily difficult.  If you have problems,
feel free to contact me and I will try to help.

What to Install
---------------
JLDrill is written in Ruby and uses GTK2 as it's GUI toolkit.  You
will need to install the following before installing JLDrill.

* Ruby 1.8
* GTK+ 2.6 or higher
* Ruby-Gnome2

JLDrill has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).
It should work on any platform that supports Ruby, Gtk and Ruby-Gnome
(including Windows and Apple-Macintosh).

Installing the Requirements
---------------------------
Note: These instructions are old an may be out of date.
If you experience problems, please contact me.

###Note to Myself
I need to add instructions on installing ruby-gems.

###Windows

You will probably want to install Ruby using the 
[One Click Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl)

Once that is installed, you will need to install GTK2 and
Ruby-Gnome2.  Detailed instructions on doing this are available
on the [Ruby-Gnome2 site](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows)

You are now finished installing the requirements.  Please see the
Download/Install section for details on obtaining and installing JLDrill.

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc

The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
for your distribution.  However, if you'd rather roll your own
solution,  You can find Ruby at the 
[main Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

GTK+ 2.6 can be obtained at the [GTK+ website](http://www.gtk.org/)

Finally, you will want to peruse the
[Ruby-Gnome2 install guides](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide)

Please see the Download/Install section for details on obtaining and
installing JLDrill

###Mac OSX
Unfortunately I don't have access to a Macintosh.  If someone
who has one can help me make instructions, I'd really appreciate
it.

Developers
----------
For people who wish to contribute to the development of JLDrill,
I recommend installing the following ruby gems.  This will allow
you to run the tests and build the website.

* rake
* rspec
* rcov
* webgen
