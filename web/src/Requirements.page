h2. Installing the Requirements

Installing the requirements take a little bit of effort, but you only
have to do it once.  The following are instructions for installing
them on Windows and Linux(/BSD/Un*x/etc) systems.  

Please note that these instructions haven't been tested yet.  Try them
out and tell me if they are right!

h3. Windows

You will probably want to install Ruby using the 
"One Click Ruby Installer":http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl

Once that is installed, you will need to install GTK2 and
Ruby-Gnome2.  Detailed instructions on doing this are available
on the "Ruby-Gnome2 site":http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows

Please see the Download/Install section for details on obtaining and
installing JLDrill

h3. GNU/Linux, BSD, U*nix, etc

The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
for your distribution.  However, if you'd rather roll your own
solution,  You can find Ruby at the "main Ruby website":http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

GTK+ 2.6 can be obtained at the "GTK+ website":http://www.gtk.org/

Finally, you will want to peruse the 
"Ruby-Gnome2 install guides":http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide
