JLDrill Requirements
====================

Important Note:
---------------
Version 0.3.0 does not have an easy to use installer.  This
is planned for version 0.4.0.  I apologize for this, but
infortunately functionality issues had priority for the
current version.  Installation is complicated at the present
time, but not necessarily difficult.  If you have problems,
feel free to contact me and I will try to help.

What to Install
---------------
JLDrill is written in Ruby and uses GTK2 as it's GUI toolkit.  You
will need to install the following before installing JLDrill.

* Ruby 1.8
* rubygems
* GTK+ 2.6 or higher
* Ruby-Gnome2 0.16 or higer

JLDrill has been developed and tested on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).
It should work on any platform that supports Ruby, Gtk and Ruby-Gnome
(including Windows and Apple-Macintosh).

Installing the Requirements
---------------------------

###Windows

The installation of the requirements for Windows is not very complicated.
Unfortunately they are rather large downloads and install a lot of things
that you won't need just to run JLDrill.  In a future release I will create
a streamlined installer that includes only the things you need.

You will probably want to install Ruby using the 
[One Click Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl).
This is very convenient because it also installs rubygems and puts everything
in your path.

Once that is installed, you will need to install GTK2 and
Ruby-Gnome2.  Detailed instructions on doing this are available
on the [Ruby-Gnome2 site](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide+for+Windows).
Again, the installation is rather simple and it installs the GTK2
libraries at the same time as the ruby-gnome libraries.

You are now finished installing the requirements.  Please see the
[Download/Install](Install.html) section for details on obtaining and 
installing JLDrill.

###GNU/Linux, BSD, Unix-like, etc

The easiest way to install the prerequisites is to find the packages
for your distribution.  I have tested everything with the packages
available from Debian and Ubuntu (Hardy Heron).  

Note: The Debian and Ubuntu package for rubygems puts the gems
in /var/lib/gems/1.8.  In order to be able to run JLDrill you need to
add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin in your path.  I have added
<pre>
export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
export RUBYOPT=rubygems
</pre>
to the end of my .bashrc file.

If you'd rather roll your own solution for installation,  You can find Ruby at the 
[main Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  Please note: The
gnome-gtk bindings do *not* work with Ruby 1.9.  You will have to install
Ruby 1.8.

Now you need to install RubyGems.  You can find documentation on doing that
at the [RubyGems website](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3).

GTK+ 2.6 can be obtained at the [GTK+ website](http://www.gtk.org/)

Finally, you will want to follow the
[Ruby-Gnome2 install guides](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Install+Guide)

Please see the Download/Install section for details on obtaining and
installing JLDrill

###Mac OSX
Unfortunately I don't have access to a Macintosh.  Installation of
GTK+ and ruby-gnome is difficult and requires a developer level of
knowledge.  If there is anyone with OSX who wants to work on an
easy way to install this, please contact me.

The difficulty of getting this running on OSX has caused me to consider
choosing a different widget library for JLDrill.  It is possible I will
change in the near future.

Developers
----------
For people who wish to contribute to the development of JLDrill,
I recommend installing the following ruby gems.  This will allow
you to run the tests and build the website.

* rake
* rspec
* rcov
* webgen
