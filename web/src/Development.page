Development Version
===================

**Latest Completed Development Version:**  [jldrill-0.3.1](http://sakabatou.dnsdojo.org/devel/jldrill/jldrill-0.3.1)

For details on development versions, see below.

If you've been following development of JLDrill for a while, you can
see that stable releases are few an far between.  I'm hoping to change
that in the near future, but sometimes I'm lazy about updating this
site.  However, I actually do make updates to the code fairly
frequently (usually every week).

Usually the development version is quite stable (it's the one I
use every day).  So if you want something more cutting edge, or
you would like to get involved in doing development on JLDrill you
can always get the latest code from the
[JLDrill BZR Repository](http://sakabatou.dnsdojo.org/devel/jldrill/).

Note that JLDrill is built upon Context, which is a library for
abstracting user interfaces using MVP (Model View Presentor).  So
you will need the Context code as well.  It is available from the
[Context BZR Repository](http://sakabatou.dnsdojo.org/devel/context/).

BZR is a distributed version control system.  You can get more
information on BZR and download it from the 
[Bazaar Home Page](http://bazaar-vcs.org/).

After you get the development trees you will need to install the
following gems:

* rake
* rspec
* rcov
* webgen

The current version of webgen doesn't play well with the version
of rubygems in Debian and Ubuntu, unfortunately.  So you will have
too install version 0.5.3 of webgen (gem install -v 0.5.3 webgen).
Also webgen has a lot of optional dependencies that are necessary.
Keep running webgen and installing the dependencies until it stops
complaining.

Once you have everthing installed you will be able to package
the files using:

<pre>
		rake package
</pre>

I am actively encouraging people to help in the development of
JLDrill.  If you want to contribute, please send me patches,
suggestions, etc.  There are a few areas I need specific help.

* User interface design.  All suggestions are welcome.  Anyone who
wants to work in this area can do as much as they want :-)
* Windows/OS X packaging.  Honestly, I don't want to do this at all.
Windows is hard for me to use and I don't even have a Mac.  So I would
be happy to hand this over to anyone who is keen.
* Web page development/documentation.  I don't mind doing this, but
frankly I'm not that great at it.  And there is really more work than
I can do myself.
* Content development.  The content that exists now is the content
that I am studying.  It would be better to have more (or better)
content.
* Itch scratching.  If you like to code, I welcome any and all patches
of functionality.  But I have to insist on tests (even though I have
occasionally been lax in that area).  I'm happy to work with you on
tests if you have difficulty writing them, though.

Development Versions
--------------------
Development versions of JLDrill have a version number like 0.3.x where
x is not 0.  In Release versions, the number is 0.  To understand
development versions you have to understand my process a little bit.

I will give an example.  Let's say I released version 0.3.0.  That
is the "Release version" and you know it is because the last number
is a 0.  This is a stable release that I expect end users to be able
to use.  After I release this version, I will start to work on
0.3.1.  This is a "Development version".  You know it's development
because the last number isn't 0.

But while I'm working on it it isn't completed yet.  It might not even
work properly.  This is known as the "Current Development Version".
You can look at this web page to see what it is (see below).  There
is no reason to use a current development version unless you are
modifying it. 

When I am finished doing what I want to do for that development
version, it will be complete.  I will update this page to show
what the "Latest Completed Development Version" is.  I will
also try to show what I've done to the version.

The Latest Completed Development Version is a bleeding edge
version of JLDrill.  I expect it to work.  Some features might
be incomplete and there might be bugs.  But it should work.
You can use it if you really need the new features, or if
you want to join in on testing.
