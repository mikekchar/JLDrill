h2. Features Planned for 0.2.0

* Make it more obvious when items are not the same as
in the dictionary. Status: Done in CVS but ugly.

* Indicators which show you some of the relevant EDICT
tags for the word. Status: Done in CVS

* Version 0.1.0 only quizes you on the Kanji (or an optional hint)
together with reading.  Version 0.2.0 will start quizing you on the
definitions and let you guess the reading as you get to know the
vocabulary better.  Then as you get a lot better, it quizes you on the
kanji.  Status: Experimental Implementation Done in CVS version.

* Speed up Dictionary reading.  Status: 2-3X improvement in CVS
version.  But it's still a bit slow (23 seconds on my machine).

* Drill construction tool.  At the moment, if you want to write a
new drill you have to use a text editor to create either a UTF8 Edict
file, or a JLDrill file (whose format is currently undocumented).
Ideally one would search the reference dictionary and then insert new
vocabulary into the drill.  Also you must be able to order the
vocabulary in the drill. Status: Abandoned 

* Kanji only drills.  Status: Abandoned

h2. Planned for 0.3.0

* Leitner system for long term retention.

* Use current drill as short term aquisition and schedule items
so that the user can have a consistent length for review.

* Improve JLPT 4 and 3 vocab so that they are correct.

* Improve the code and create a full test suite.

h2. Long term improvements:

* Easier install and run for Windows
* Leitner style flash card system
