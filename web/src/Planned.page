Planned features
===========================
Here is a prioritized list of planned features.  If you think
the priority is wrong, please email me.  If you think of another
feature, please email me.

* Memory usage and speed.  JLDrill uses a *lot* of memory.  When
the dictionary is loaded it's up to about 290 megs on my machine.
I've discovered the root of the problem and the fix should also
dramatically speed up dictionary loading. **Status: done**
* Drill construction tool.  We need to be able to make a brand new drill.
We need to be able to delete items.  We need to be able to move items up and
down in order. **Status: done**
* Finish correcting JLPT level 2 content.  **Status: ~1500 vocab reviewed**
* Specific mode for grammar drills.  **Status: Not done**
* Easier installation. **Status: Not done**
* Kanji only drills with Heisig style stories.  **Status: Not done**
* A kanji story generator with a tool to find kanji that have the same radicals.  
**Status: Not done**
