Planned features
===========================
Here is a prioritized list of planned features.  If you think
the priority is wrong, please email me.  If you think of another
feature, please email me.

* Drill construction tool.  We need to be able to make a brand new drill.
We need to be able to delete items.  We need to be able to move items up and
down in order. **Status: Not done**
* Easier installation. **Status: Not done**
* Specific mode for grammar drills.  **Status: Not done**
* Finish correcting JLPT level 2 content.  **Status: 1330 vocab reviewed**
* Kanji only drills with Heisig style stories.  **Status: Not done**
* A kanji story generator with a tool to find kanji that have the same radicals.  
**Status: Not done**
* Speed up Dictionary reading.  Reading the dictionary is still too slow.
Probably the easiest way to make it faster is to write an extension.
