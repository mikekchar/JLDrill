Planned features
===========================

I used to keep an overview of the planned features here, but it gets
out of date too quickly.  If you wish to see the current TODO list,
please look at the [development branch
website](http://sakabatou.dnsdojo.org/devel/jldrill/TODO.html)

The TODO list shows the current development in the development stream
and also the list of features that I plan to implement in the future.
That list is called the backlog.  If you have any ideas or if you
have a preference for the order in which I tackle the backlog, please
contact me.
