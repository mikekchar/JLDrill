Acknowledgements
================
This program could not have been written if it were not for the
contribution that others have made.  Normally JLDrill will be
distributed with data files that are used for creating the drills.
These data files required an enormous amount of work to compile and
their authors deserve to be given some credit.

In particular I want to thank The Electronic Dictionary Research and
Development Group at Monash University.  JLDrill uses the EDICT files
for it's reference dictionary.  Without this monumental work, very
little could be done in the world of free software with respect to
Japanese language training.  I am deeply in their debt.

I would also like to thank Thierry Bézecourt for the use of the
files which form the basis of the JLPT drills.  Thierry has very
kindly granted permission to use these files in this application
under the GPL license, thus saving me weeks of work.

Finally, I would like to thank [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org) for
hosting this project.  It makes a big difference.
