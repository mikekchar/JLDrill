Learning Japanese with JLDrill
=================

Introduction
------------

It may be that you have come to this site, wanting to learn Japanese,
but not knowing how to approach it.  In this case I'd like to offer
some advice on how to learn Japanese based on the experience I've
had over the years.  One thing I've learned, though, is that over time
I learn more and more what works for me.  I have changed my approach
many times as I've learned more effective techniques.  No matter what
you read, or what people tell you, be flexible in your approach and
observe how well various things work for you.  It might be very different
than what works for me.

Often people are put off by the apparant complexity of the Japanese
language.  Even Japanese people will tell you that their language
is impossible to learn.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  In
reality, Japanese is not particularly more difficult than any
other language.  However, because of the writing system and the various
levels of polite speech, there is a lot of material.  It is not
complicated, but it will take you a long time to master.  If you are patient
and approach it in a slow consistent manner, you will definitely succeed.

My Current Approach
-------------------

It took me a long time before I started getting traction learning Japanese.
I am not a natural learner of languages.  It takes me a considerable
amount of effort.  But over time, I've discovered techniques that work
for me.  They are relatively simple and have the advantage that they
don't require an investment in money.  In fact, I don't recommend buying
a textbook or taking a class if you don't want to.

It is posible to learn Japanese using only free materials that you can
get on the internet.  And you can do it in your free time using whatever
schedule is available to you.  However, there is a caveat.  You must
study every day.  The study is light and pleasant, but it must happen
every day, or else you will not retain the information.  So find a time
where you can study and be consistent.  Regardless of how much time you
spend each day, this consistency will guarrantee results eventually.

Learn To Read
-------------

Learning to read in Japanese is the first thing you should do.  For many
people, this is probably a surprising statement.  Very often people decide
that they won't learn to read at all, thinking that it will be too hard
and they don't need it anyway.  But reading is the foundation to learning
the language quickly.  Yes, you can learn the language aurally just like
a child.  But do you really want to spend 5 years studying the language
only to be able to speak like a 5 year old?

Reading allows us to use our adult brains to aid in the process of learning.
Japanese is especially well suited to learning through reading because
it uses Chinese characters in its writing system.  These characters act
like mnemonic reminders that allow us to learn and remember vocabulary
much more easily.  Learning to read, more than anything else I've done,
has accellerated my progress.

There are 3 writing systems in Japanese.  This may sound like an unneccessarily
large number, but it's actually much simpler than it seems.  2 of the writing
systems are phonetic (just like our alphabet).  Having 2 phonetic scripts
seems like a lot, but consider that our roman alphabet has both upper and
lower case letters.  Japanese has hiragana (for Japanese words and grammar)
and katakana (for words borrowed from other languages).  Katakana is also
used like italics in English writing, and is often found on signs.

The absolute first thing you should do (even before you learn how to
say "Hello") is to learn hiragana.  This will help you in many ways.
Japanese people have learned how to use our roman alphabet, which they
call romaji, and often suggest that beginners read Japanese using
that alphabet.  However, the language is imperfectly represented by
romaji and using it leads to confusion and mispronunciation.  Stay
away from romaji at all costs!

Luckily, learning hiragana takes much less time than you will suspect.
After 1 or 2 weeks of study, you will be able to read both hiragana
and katakana relatively easily.  Some people can do so after only
a few days (alas, I was not one of these).  You can use JLDrill to
practice hiragana and katakana.

There are two things you should do when practicing these letters.
The first is to pronounce the sounds out loud when you review them.
Japanese has an almost perfectly consistent pronunciation.  So
when you see a letter, you always know how to pronounce it (unlike
English!).  So get into the habit of pronouncing it as you read it.

The other thing you should do is write the character each time.  This
is surprising advice.  Again, most people feel that learning to write
is not necessary and will take too much time.  In fact, learning to
write the characters will dramatically speed up the time it takes
to learn them.  The muscle memory that you create will help you
remember the characters very easily and retain the memory for a long
time.

To learn how to write the character, press control-K in JLDrill.
This will load the kanji/kana information.  Then you can hover the
mouse over the hiragana or katakana character.  This will pop up
a "stroke order diagram" of the character.  Simply follow the
numbers on the diagram to determine which order to draw the lines.
"Stroke order", or the order in which you draw the lines, is much
more important to readability in Japanese than the shape.  Japanese
people recognize the characters more by how the lines connect
than from the overall shape, and in fact handwritten characters
often look nothing like what you think they should.  So you must
*always* draw the strokes in the right order.  This will allow you
to write and read the characters in all situations.

Note that you don't actually have to draw the characters on a
piece of paper.  It is sufficient simply to trace the character
on the desk with your finger.  Once you know the character it
only takes you one or two times of practice drawing it for
real to get it looking nice.

The Next Step
-------------

What you do after you know how to read kana (hiragana and katakana)
depends on your needs.  If you are planning a trip to Japan, or
have some reason to interact with Japanese people right away,
you will need to learn some idiomatic expressions.  You probably
will want to learn how to say, "Hello", "Goodbye", "Good Morning",
etc.

But before you do so, let me give you a warning.  Many of these
expressions use advanced and sometimes old/bizarre grammar.  Greeting
people in Japanese is something you must be polite about, and so
very polite forms are generally used.  In Japanese the way to be
polite is to add a whole bunch of mostly meaningless grammar at
the end of a sentence.  So when you learn these idiomatic expressions
you will be learning very long and complicated jumbles of
syllables.  I believe this is mostly what give Japanese it's
undeserved reputation for being complicated.

Interestingly, if you walk up to a 3 or 4 year old Japanese child
and greet them politely, they will probably just run away
from you.  That's because they haven't learned these expressions.
These idiomatic expressions, that beginner language learners
usually try first, are things that even Japanese people
find complicated.  So unless you are going to meet Japanese people
right away, there's no particular reason to learn them first.

But I realize that it seems strange to learn a language and not
even know how to say "hello".  Therefore I recommend going
to [Japanese Podcast 101](http://www.japanesepod101.com) and
learning these basics.  It's a free podcast that teaches you
Japanese.  You have to understand how to use these idiomatic
expressions and when they are appropriate.  The podcast
does a very good job of explaining these issues.

Ideally, you would have a list of vocabulary that you learn
from these podcasts to put into JLDrill to study.  Unfortunately
I don't currently have this.  But you can create your own 
drills.  First press control-D to load the dictionary.  It will
take about 30 seconds to load.  Then press "+" to add a
new entry for your quiz (if you have just started JLDrill, the
quiz will be empty -- subsequent versions of JLDrill will have
the ability to create an empty drill at will).

Listen very closely to the sound of the word and try to
write it using hiragana in the "Reading" part of the form
(you will have to learn how to use the IME, or Input Method
Editor, on your computer to write hiragana -- instructions
are outside the scope of this document).  Then press the
"Search" button.  You may have to try a couple of times
to get the spelling right, but JLDrill only requires that
you type the *start* of the word -- you don't have to type
the whole thing.  Once you find the expression in the
dictionary (most common ones are there), you press the
"Add" button to add it to your quiz.  This will allow
you to review your vocabulary.

The Secret To Speaking is Grammar
---------------------------------

Learning a lot of set expressions will get you quite a long way
in Japanese.  In fact, I know foreigners in Japan who have lived
here very comfortably for years only knowing common expressions.
But you can't have a conversation, or express any novel ideas.

One of the most frustrating experiences when learning a language
happens when someone says something to you and you can't
respond.  You understand exactly what they are saying, but
you can't formulate a response.  You will often hear people
say, "My Japanese is pretty good and I understand a lot, but
for some reason I can't say anything".

This is because the person understands their vocabulary and
grammar, but the grammatical expressions are not deeply
ingrained enough to spring to the mind when formulating
sentences.  Often they will resort to translating from
English, using English expressions.  The result is slow
and halting and probably incomprehensible to the average
Japanese person.

In order to speak, a person must have the grammar ingrained
so that it instinctively comes out.  And there is only
one way to get the grammar ingrained so strongly -- practice.

There are two ways to practice.  The first way is one you experienced
when you learned your first language.  It is an interactive
and cooperative approach.  You have one or more people who
already understand the language.  They model language constructs
and prompt you to try them.  They patiently listen to you
and correct you when you make mistakes.  Then they model
the language again.  You pass it back and forth until the language
becomes second nature.

This is the very natural approach you took when your parents
taught you your native language.  It's natural, and comfortable.
If you have a good teacher it can be fantastic.  Recently,
techniques like TPR (Total Physical Response), which mimic this
approach, have been used to great success in classrooms.

But there's a downside to this approach.  You need a willing
and patient teacher.  This is great if you can find one, have
the time to go to class every day, and can afford to pay
the huge cost of a daily lesson.  But what if you are alone
(or poor)?  What can you do?

The alternative is something we are also all familiar with --
rote memorization.  You are given a model and you practice that
model until you memorize it.  Then you apply the model in
real conversation.

This approach also has disadvantages.  First, it's boring.  Many
people have difficulty memorizting things.  That's why JLDrill
was written.  The intent is to make rote memorization as fast,
comfortable and pleasant as possible.  The second problem to memorization
is that it has an extra step.  Once you memorize the model, you
must practice it with a real person in order to get used to 
applying the model to new situations and vocabulary.  So
you still need to talk to people.  But the need for cooperation
with others is much less than the interactive approach.

You don't have to chose one approach exclusively.  It's OK to
mix and match, possibly using one approach to supplement the
other.  But since this is discussing JLDrill, I will discuss
the memorization approach (the approach I tend to use, even though
I'm "bad" at memorization).

The approach I've used with the most success is to obtain
a good grammar text book. Luckily, the best one I've found
is free and available for download on the internet.
It is 
[Tae Kim's Japanese Guide to Japanese Grammar](http://www.japaneseguide.org).
Tae Kim introduces the grammar concepts in a logical and
understandable order.  And most importantly introduces "plain"
form before "polite" form.

Usually polite form is taught first.  The rational is that if
one wants to talk to Japanese people one should learn polite
form first.  This allows you to have discussions with
strangers without being rude.  Later they teach plain form which
is what you would use with your close friends and family.

But this approach is flawed.  First of all, when you are a beginner,
you do not have the ability to have conversations.  You just
don't have enough grammar and vocabulary.  So you are only
really capable of set expressions anyway.  Second, polite grammar
is complicated in that it has a lot more grammar than is
necessary (it's this extra grammar that you must take care
to say that makes it polite).  

But the most important point is that the Japanese language is
built on plain form.  People think in plain form.  It is easy
to change from plain form to polite form, but the reverse
is conceptually difficult.  This is another reason why people
consider Japanese difficult.  Save yourself a considerable amount
of pain and learn plain form first.

Luckily the amount of plain form grammar you must learn before
you learn polite form is actually quite small.  So unless you
desparately must speak in a polite situation to strangers,
just avoid polite form until you have a good grounding in
the language.

The approach I take is to read a chapter of Tae Kim's book.
Then I memorize all the vocabulary.  Then I memorize the 
example sentences in the chapter.  Taking advantage of
JLDrill's spaced repetition I then review the example
sentences over time.  I have found that this is all that
I need to do in order to effectively use the grammar
in conversation.

If you want to try this approach, you can use the
grammar.jldrill drill file that I made.  It contains
about the first half of the material in Tae Kim's
book (hopefully I will finish it for the next release).
Simply read a chapter of the book.  Then allow JLDrill
to present the material for memorization/review.
Stop when you reach the material for the next chapter
(you can tell because I introduce vocabulary for each
chapter first and then sentences.  When you start
getting new vocabulary to learn, you know you
are at the next chapter).

The Vocabulary Grind
--------------------

Once you start learning, you may be very surprised to
realize that Japanese grammar is quite simple and consistent.
There isn't even all that much to learn.  Using JLDrill
you could probably read a chapter of Tae Kim's guide every day
and review the material for an hour or so.  In that way
it would only take you a few months to learn almost all the
important grammar in the language.

But the real difficult part of Japanese is not the grammar:
it's the vocabulary.  Speaking Japanese well requires quite
a big vocabulary since it uses whole sets of different
vocabulary for different social situations.  In fact the
JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) includes 10,000
words that you should memorize in order to be considered
at all fluent in the language.

So the vast majority of your time will be spent learning
and reviewing vocabulary.  You might be feeling a bit
overwhelmed.  With 10,000 common words to choose from,
which should you learn first?  Luckily, there's an
easy answer to this question.

The JLPT has 4 levels.  The lowest level is level 4 and the
highest is level 1.  Each level has roughly twice as much
material as the level before it.  So level 4 has 800 words,
level 3 1500, Level 2 3000 and level 1 5000.  In my opinion,
learning the level 4 vocabulary first, followed by level 3
followed by 2 and then 1 is actually a very effective way
to learn the language.  The levels really are good indicators
of the utility of the vocabulary.

JLDrill has vocabulary quizes for all 4 levels.  Unfortunately
the vocabulary lists were compiled using a partially automated
process and many mistakes were made.  I have reviewed and corrected
the vocabulary for levels 4 and 3.  I've also made my way through
about 1/3 of level 2.  Hopefully I will have these all reviewed by
the next release.

You can feel relatively safe reviewing levels 4 and 3.  But if
you start reviewing level 2 and 1 material you should check
the vocabulary.  You can do this quite easily.  When you
are learning new vocabulary, load the dictionary by pressing
control-D.  It takes about 30 seconds to load.  After that,
whenever a word is different than what's in the dictionary,
the "Differs" button in the upper right corner will turn red.
When that happens, simply press "e" to edit the vocabulary.

This will bring up the vocabulary edit dialog.
JLDrill will automatically search the dictionary (if it is
loaded) for the word and give you the candidate matches.
It does this by searching for the reading and giving you
all the words that start with that sound.  The search
currently ignores the kanji (this may be improved in
a subsequent release).  Simply
click on the correct dictionary entry and press the "Set"
button.  This will set the item to the vocabulary you selected.

Being consistent at reviewing vocabulary is the secret to
learning the language quickly.  As was previously mentioned,
learning vocabulary will take up the bulk of your time.
If you are consistent, you can learn it surprisingly quickly.

There are 10,000 words in the entire JLPT test.  If you
can pass the test, your Japanese is good enough to go
to a Japanese university or work at a Japanese job.
10,000 seems like a really huge amount of work.  But
is it really?

Let's say that we work every day, taking 2 weeks off for
a holiday.  That's about 350 days.  If we introduce
only 30 new words per day, we will easily introduce all
of them in only 1 year.  And if you are using JLDrill
then you will be reviewing them every day and so will
have at least a 90% retention rate by the end of the year.
So how much time will that take.

For me, it takes about 90 seconds to introduce
a new word.  Usually the daily review is about twice
what your introduction rate is, so in this case
60 words.  Reviewing each word takes me about 10 seconds.
I will need to reintroduce words that I miss, so
the total time needed is just a little over 1 hour
a day.

So consider that the investment of only an hour a day will
bring you very close to fluency in a period of a year.
But only if you are consistent.  I know from experience
that skipping even one or two days can really cause problems.
Someone once told me that it's like running up an escalator
while it's going down.  If you don't keep going up, you
won't make any progress.

So no matter what amount of time you put in, you should
feel confident that you can attain fluency in only a few
years *if you study consistently every day*.  In fact, I
beleive that this is the *only* cause of failure in
language learning.  Just study every day and you will
succeed.  Certain techniques may speed you up or slow
you down, but consistency controls success or
failure absolutely.

But what about Kanji?
---------------------

So far I haven't talked about kanji.  Kanji are the characters
in the third writing system (the other two being hiragana
and katakana).  Unlike kana, kanji is not phonetic.  It is
conceptual.

It is a common misunderstanding that kanji characters represent
words.  This is not true.  They are more of an alphabet that
represents concepts rather than sounds.  A word can be made up
of one kanji character, but it could also be made up of
several.

The important thing is that each kanji character has a distinct
meaning which can help you memorize the word.  For example,
the word 鉛筆 means pencil.  It is pronounced えんぴつ (or in
romaji, enpitsu).  The character 鉛 means "lead" (i.e., the
metal) and is pronounced えん (en in romaji).  The character 筆
mean brush and is pronounced ぴつ (pitsu in romaji).

Note: I'm giving you the romaji since I assume you haven't studied
hiragana yet, but generally you should avoid romaji like the plague.
When you learn how to pronounce the hiragana, you will see that
it is pronounced differently than you would expect from the
romaji.

So pencil is made up of the characters lead - brush.  This is
quite easy to remember.  A pencil *is* a lead brush if you
consider a brush analogous to a writing tool (originally Japanese
people used only brushes and ink for writing).  And if you
know that lead is pronounced えん and brush is pronounced ぴつ,
then it's very easy to remember that pencil is えんぴつ.

Kanji *helps* you learn Japanese vocabulary.  So it is well
worth investing the time to learn the kanji as you learn the
vocabulary.  Overall, I have found that I learn kanji and
vocabulary together twice as fast as I learn the vocabulary
alone.  And as a bonus I avoid being illiterate!

But there are some complications.  First, in case you didn't notice,
the characters look quite complicated.  The first time you see them
they look like a random collection of squiggles.  How can you possibly
memorize them quickly?

Another complication is that each character has more than one way
to pronounce it (called a "reading", because that's how you read
it).  Usually it has at least 2 and sometimes as many as 10 or 15!
How can you possibly memorize all the readings of a kanji and remember
which reading to use for which word?

Finally, there are *lots* of kanji.  To be literate you need to
know at least 2100 characters.  Most University graduates know
more than 3000 characters and there are about 60,000 characters
which pop up from time to time in publications.  How can you
possibly learn so many in a reasonable time frame? It takes
Japanese people 12 years of school to learn the first 2000 or 
so.

Luckily, it's not nearly as complicated as it all seems.  In fact,
I consider learning kanji the most interesting and fun part of
learning Japanese.  But you *do* need to approach the task
systematically and with a little bit of technique.

Let's address the first complication.  The characters appear complex.
Well, there are tens of thousands of characters, so obviously you
have to make it *somewhat* complicated.  But as it turns out, the
characters are actually formed in a logical way.  Once you learn the
logical method, memorizing the characters is much easier.

Each character is made up of parts called "radicals".  For example,
the character, 鉛, is made up of 3 radicals: 金 on the left hand side,
八 on the upper right and 口 on the lower right.  金 means metal.
八 means enter and 口 means mouth.  It turns out that 八 sitting
on top of 口 is rather common and in each of the characters in
which it appears can be thought of as a kind of gully into which
a flow of something (usually water) goes.  It's the entry into
the mouth of the flow.  So 鉛 can be thought of as the metal
that flows into a gully -- a good description for lead.  The
apparently complex radical (which is also a kanji character),
金, can also be broken down into parts.  In this way it becomes
relatively easy to memorize the characters.

There is a book called "Remembering the Kanji" by James Heisig.
He was the first to describe a method of memorizing kanji by
breaking it down into parts and telling a "story" with the
parts.  The first section of his book is available for 
[free download as a PDF.](http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/miscPublications/pdf/RK4/RK%201_sample.pdf)
I highly recommend reading it.

That being said, after buying the book and working through a 
little more than half of the kanji, I gave up on the book.  I 
believe the method is excellent.  However, some of the keywords 
assigned to kanji parts are clearly arbitrary and sometimes (in 
the case where they are a kanji character themselves) even wrong.
I found that it was causing me enough trouble that I wanted
to start over using a different order and new keywords for
many of the kanji parts.

Eventually I will have a tool in JLDrill to facilitate researching
kanji characters for this activity.  However it currently
does not do this.  Nor does it easily allow reviewing of
kanji characters and keywords.  So for now I recommend using
Heisig's book.

Once you understand how to easily remember the kanji, using
them as mnemonic devices for learning vocabulary is quite
natural.  Virtually every Japanese word can be understood
simply by looking at its kanji.  And once you have learned
many of the kanji, you can often understand words you
have never seen before simply by looking at the kanji.  This
speeds up vocabulary memorization greatly.

This leaves learning the readings (pronunciations) of the characters.
The most usual method here is to simply memorize them using
flash cards, or a spaced repetition program like JLDrill.
And you could probably make drills like that if you wanted
to.  However, in practice, I've found it completely unneccessary.
Simply learning vocabulary causes me to remember the readings of
the kanji.  Probably this is because I learn the vocabulary
using the kanji as a mnemonic.  This reinforces the
sound of the kanji in my head.  And the fact that there are
many different readings for each kanji doesn't seem to
confuse me.  So I don't recommend doing anything in particular
to learn the pronunciation of kanji.

Finally, we have the problem of the large numbers of kanji.
For the JLPT tests it is important to be able to read the
roughly 2100 kanji that are required for literacy.  This
will also enable you to read newspapers, books, street signs,
menus, ingredients on food boxes, etc.  If you ever go
to Japan without learning kanji, you will quickly discover
how difficult it is to live being illiterate.

But what order should these kanji be learned?  Heisig has
his own order which he feels is optimal.  I understand
his reasoning, but I personally don't like his order.
The JLPT tests have an order that is roughly similar
to the order that they are introduced to Japanese school
children.  This is better, but not ideal since they
include characters that are only commonly used in names
(something you probably won't have to deal with early
on).  Also there are many common words in the vocabulary
lists for which they don't feel you need to know the
kanji.  This breaks my technique of using the kanji
as a mnemonic for the vocabulary.

I feel strongly that the kanji learned should be driven
by the vocabulary you are learning.  You should learn
the kanji that are in the vocabulary.  You should also
learn the kanji that are used as building blocks for
the kanji in your vocabulary.  If you do this, you should
naturally learn all the kanji as you learn vocabulary.

I would like to provide a tool that automatically selects
the kanji you should learn based on your vocabulary and
drills you appropriately.  Unfortunately I haven't gotten
that far yet.  So at the moment you are on your own to
create your own method.

Currently, if you press control-K it will load up some
kanji information.  Hovering over a kanji character with
the mouse will show a stroke order diagram for the
character.  It will also show a list of readings for the
character, a list of potential english keywords for
the character and a list of radicals (building blocks)
for the character along with their meanings.  It's enough
to get you started, but probably not sufficient.  In
time I will try to provide something better.

Conclusion
----------
Congratulations if you made it all the way to the bottom of this document!
Even with so much text, I still feel that I've left a lot out.  But doubtless
will find your own methods that work well for you.  To summarize my
points, the list of tips, in order of importance are:

- Study every day, 7 days a week.  Pick an amount of time that works for you.
    It needn't be a lot, but it must be every day.
- Learn to read.  Don't let the complexity of the written language put
    you off.  You can learn the written and the spoken language *faster*
    than you can learn the spoken language alone.
- Use hiragana and katakana to reinforce your pronunciation.  Avoid
    romaji at all costs!
- Trace the characters you learn (kana and kanji) using your finger as
    you review them.  Use the control-K feature in JLDrill to load the
    kanji/kana information and hover the mouse over the characters you
    want more info on.
- Memorize example sentences to practice grammar.  Once you have them
    memorized, start using the patterns in real conversations.  Notice
    how you can call up the forms easily since they are memorized.
- Don't get discouraged learning vocabulary.  Just plug away every
    day.  As long as you do a little bit every day you are going forward.
    And as long as your are going forward you will reach the end.
    But *don't* miss days or else you will be going *backwards*!
- Use kanji as a mnemonic to learn vocabulary.
- Don't bother to learn the readings of the kanji separately from the
    vocabulary.  If you are like me, you'll remember them anyway with
    no effort.
- Try to learn the English keywords for each kanji as you learn
    vocabulary.  This will help you use them as mnemonics.
    
Good luck with your studies!
