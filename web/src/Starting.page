h2. Starting Japanese

h2. Introduction

I think most people will come to this website already having a certain
amount of Japanese education under their belt.  They want a drill
program and they already know how they want to use it.  For them, I
don't need to give any instructions.  They are going to do what they
want anyway.  However, for those people who are just starting to
learn, I've compiled a few tips on getting started in Japanese.

Despite what most people will say, Japanese isn't particularly more
difficult to learn than any other language.  In fact, I find it
substantially easier to learn than French (the other language that I
don't speak very well).  Even though it is not complex, there is a
large amount of information that you need to amass.

So where can you start?  My very first recommendation is to take an
introductory course.  Having studied on my own for some time, I can
say with experience that it is much more difficult than taking
courses.  I have progressed much more slowly than other people I
know.  You can find courses at local colleges and universities.  Often
high schools and community centers will also give classes.  This is
the single easiest approach to learning Japanese.  If you have this
option available, take it.

Sometimes, though, you just can't take a course.  In my case, I work
in a very small town and I can't get to the city in time to make any
classes I've seen offered.  It is just impossible for me to take a
course.  Or maybe you just can't afford to take a class.  What to do
then?  Well, there are many things you can do on your own.  You will
have to work hard and be very disciplined, but you can do it.

h2. My Approach

After several years of basically getting nowhere, I have settled on
this approach, which seems to work well for me.  Hopefully it will
work for you too.

h3. Get a Text Book

If you can possibly afford it, I recommend getting a Japanese
textbook.  It is difficult in the extreme to learn Japanese without a
good introductory text.  While there are several tutorial style web
pages around, I haven't seen anything that is comprehensive enough to
be used as a good starting point.  I recommend the following
textbooks:

* "Genki 1":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4789009637/qid=1134830453/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4142393-8920800?n=507846&s=books&v=glance
* "Japanese for Busy People 1: Kana Version":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4770019874/qid=1134830575/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/002-4142393-8920800?s=books&v=glance&n=283155

These are probably the top two recommended text books that I have seen.
I own the first and have looked through the second (I have more or less
permanently borrowed it from my friend).  Personally, I like Genki the
best, but it is about $40 US.  Japanese for Busy People is only $16 US
and is a real bargain.  Honestly, I consider this a must have so don't
scrimp here.

Personally, I <em>don't</em> recommend any other introductory text books at
all.  I own several (which I won't mention) and have found them all
unsatisfactory.  

What do you do if you can't afford $16 US + S&H?  I can understand
that too.  Maybe you're a starving student, or just plain starving.
Been there, done that.  Well, there are a few options.  The first is
to go to your library and see what they have.  Even the bad text books
are better than nothing.  You might get lucky and stumble across a
good book.  Or they might have nothing at all.

In that case, your only hope is to go through as many website
tutorials as you can.  The best compilation of links I have found is
the "Japanese Language site here":http://infohost.nmt.edu/~armiller/japanese/japanese.htm
Scroll down to lessons and see what you can find.

h3. Learn Kana

While you are trying to find a textbook, there's no reason not to
start learning immediately.  You might as well learn your kana.  In
japanese there are 3 native scripts for writing.  These are hirargana,
katakana and kanji.  The first 2 are phonetic "alphabets" (similar to
our alphabet), while the third is a set of ideograms borrowed from
Chinese writing.  Our alphabet is also used in Japanese and is called
romaji there.

Many people are surprised to learn that Japanese has a phonetic as
well as ideographic writing system.  Japanese is one of the most
complicated writing systems in the world because it mixes all three
kinds of scripts in normal every day writing.

Collectively, hiragana and katakana are known as "kana".  These are
the phonetic scripts.  You need to learn these as soon as humanly
possible.  Why?  Because it opens up a whole new world of learning for
you.  If you can't read kana, you cut yourself off from many, many
resources.   Besides, what's the point of being able to speak and not
read.  Imagine trying to get along in your own language while being
illiterate.  It's not a nice prospect.

Luckily, you can use JLDrill to learn kana.  In fact, you will need to
know your kana to be able to use JLDrill at all.  So you might as well
get started now.  JLDrill has two drills, one for hiragana and one for
katakana.  You should start with the hiragana drill.

Hiragana is used for writing japanese words and for indicating word
<em>inflections</em> (In Japanese, the ends of words change depending
on your tense, etc.  This is called an inflection).  You will see
hiragana everywhere.  It is the most important script to learn.

Katakana describes the same phonemes as hiragana, but uses different
characters.  You can think of it like capital letters in romaji,
or italics.  It is used for "loan" words (words that were
originally in another language, but have been added to Japanese), or
for indicating some kind of stress on the word.  Usually signs are
written in katakana as well.

After you learn hiragana you should learn katakana.  To learn both,
will take somewhere between a few days and a few weeks depending on
the person.  It's not hard, so give it a go while you are searching
for that textbook.

h3. The Next Step

By the time you know your kana, you will probably have your textbook
in hand.  Now is a good time to start reading it if you haven't
already. I have a particular approach to learning which I will
describe here.  Feel free to give it a try if you find it interesting.

My approach is to read the chapter in the text book without any real
attempt at learning the material.  This is just an introduction.  Then
I memorize every piece of information there.  I do this without regard
to understanding.  Finally, I go through the information again with
emphasis on understanding.

Why do I do it in that order? Well, to make a long story short, it
gives you a built in reference book when you are trying to make the
cognitive leap from recognizing to understanding.

I am sure we're all familiar with reading some new material that we
find difficult.  Because you might have forgotten some of the basics,
you are constantly flipping pages back and forth trying to keep it in
your head all at once.  However, I have found that timing is
incredibly important to absorbing information.

If you can see a new concept and form an understanding of it in a very
short time (less than a second), it will tend to stick with you.  If
it takes you several minutes to absorb the concept, it will never
fully form and you will always be losing it.

The idea behind delaying understanding until after you have memorized
the material is that you can marshal all your facts immediately as
soon as you are trying to understand the concept.  You don't have to
go flipping around in your book.

That is the main purpose I wrote JLDrill.  It is a program designed to
efficiently allow you to memorize your material without emphasis on
understanding it. Once you have memorized it, <em>then</em> you try to
understand it.

This is a very foreign concept for most people (myself included).  I
started using this idea by copying the actions of people that were
doing better at me when I was in school.  I was very skeptical (in fact
somewhat derogatory) about the approach that they were taking, but
have now found it to be indispensible.

h3. Making Drills

Ideally, you will want to make drills of the material in your text
book.  Unfortunately, JLDrill does not make that easy right now.
Eventually it will.  For vocabulary, you can create EDICT files by
cutting and pasting from the edict.utf file in the dict directory
(usually /usr/share/jldrill/dict/edict.utf on Un*x and
c:\ruby\share\jldrill\dict\edict.utf on Windows).  Just search for the
words you are looking for and cut and paste each line into a new
file.  You can then read the file into JLDrill and save it as a drill
file.

A tool for creating vocabulary drills will be in the next version of
JLDrill. 

Unfortunately, there is no tool I know of that will help you drill
grammar.  I intend to start adding this to JLDrill in the next
revision or two.


h3. The JLPT

In the meantime, the JLPT drills in the JLDrill are useful places to
start learning vocabulary. The JLPT is the Japanese Language
Proficiency Test.  Many people take these tests to focus themselves on
achieving their next level of proficiency.  There are 4 levels,
starting with 4th kyu and culminating in 1st kyu.

A good introduction to the JLPT can be found
"here":http://www.thejapanesepage2.com/kanji/jlpt.htm

Because the JLPT has been used as an entrance requirement for Japanese
universities in the past (I don't think this is still true, but I'm
not sure), most courses and textbooks introduce material in almost the
same order as the JLPT.

So if you want to start memorizing vocabulary, the JLPT level 4 drill
is a good place to start.

IMPORTANT: The JLPT drill files in JLDrill contain several errors in
the translations.  This is not unique to JLDrill.  The kanji and kana
for the drill files was painstakingly entered by Thierry BÃ©zecourt by hand.
These files were then matched up with dictionary entries in Edict
using a computer program.  The program made a lot of mistakes.  You
need to check any entry that you're not sure about (using the
XReference feature in JLDrill).  It's not hard to tell when the wrong
translation has been used.  Usually it's because it has chosen a
non-popular translation over a popular one (indicated by having a "P"
in the markers).  Sometimes it's just wrong for one reason or another.
As you edit these drill files, I would appreciate it if you would send
them to me so that I can collate all the corrections and send them
back to Thierry.

h3. Listening

You can't learn a language without listening to it.  Luckily there are
many different options for listining to Japanese.  Do you best to
immerse yourself in Japanese as much as possible.  TV, radio, and
movies are all good bets.  It's OK if you don't understand a single
thing that they are saying.  You just want to get exposed to the
sound of the language as much as possible.

What I have done in the past is watch a program on TV.  My goal is to
catch as many words as possible that I know.  I don't really pay
attention to the show, I just try to listen to words.  If you hear a
word over and over again that you don't know, write it down and look
it up.  It's a great way to learn vocabulary.  Doing this is a lot
more fun than you might think.  It's even more fun if you have a
partner and can make a competition out of it.  See who can find the
most words.

Once you've been able to pick up some words on TV (or whereever), try
to pick up sentences.  At first you'll only be able to understand
short sentences.  But as time progresses, you'll be amazed at how many
sentences you can understand.  At this point you might even be able to
loosely understand what's going on in the show.

Having said all that, where do you get Japanese listening material?
The first place to look is your local library.  If they have the
"Pimsleur Japanese Comprehensive series":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743523539/qid=1134836832/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4142393-8920800?n=507846&s=books&v=glance 
borrow it.  And yes, if you clicked on the link, Amazon *does* sell
this for a whopping $345 US.  It is very much over priced, but if you
have the cash, it's worth it to buy.  Also search around.  You might
be able to find it for less.

These are great listening drills.  Sometime in the distant far future
I would like to be able to do something similar with JLDrill.  I've
done the first 3 of these series (90 lessons in all) and they are
definitely worth doing.  I think a fourth series has just been
released too, but I haven't seen it yet.

But there are cheaper things you can do as well.  Several Cable and
Satelite comanies around the world offer JapanTV (it costs me ~$15
Cdn per month).  I highly recommend this if you can afford it.  It's
the easiest and most convenient way to get Japanese language into your
home.  Plus the NHK (public broadcaster in Japan that creates the
content for JapanTV) is almost bankrupt and could use your support.

Finally, there are several web resources for Japanese television and
radio programs.  As far as I know none of the resources I link to here
are legal in that they infringe copyright.  From a moral perspective
though, it's hard to imagine anyone having a problem with this as the
vendors will refuse to sell you the material if you offer to buy it.
In fact, there is considerable evidence of some complicity with
respect to distribution of unlicensed anime on the internet.  But
however you slice it, it's still illegal.  I offer the following for
informational purposes only.  Use at your own risk.

The best place to find pointers to "fansubs" of Japanese anime is
"Animesuki":http://www.animesuki.com  Japanese anime are cartoons.
However, these "cartoons" are not only aimed at children but adults as
well.  There is a thriving industry for anime in Japan with tens of
new shows being introduced every season (i.e. 4 times a year).  Likely
there is something there you will like.  Virtually all genres of
stories are represented in anime.

Fansubs are localized versions of a show or movie with subtitling
provided by fans of the show.  As I mentioned earlier, all of these
fansubs infringe on copyright.  However, there is a code amongst
most fansubbers (people who make and distribute fansubbed material)
that they will only work on unlicensed material.  That means that if a
distributor is found that will sell English versions of an anime, the
fansubbers will stop translating and distributing that series.

Originally, the whole idea of fansubbing was to encourage distribution
of anime in non-japanese areas by showing a demand for the product.
These fansubbers have been very successful.  There is a considerable
amount of evididence to show that fansub distributions are used as a
free "test market" by anime producers to indicate which series will go
over well in foreign markets.  However a few producers have asked that
their series not be fansubbed.  By and large, these requests are
honoured.

As soon as a series is available legally in a region, many fansub fans
support the producers by buying the disks.  This is important because
without these sales, Japanese anime will never be available to
non-japanese.  Please support these producers. 

In addition to anime, there is a small but vibrant community who
fansub Japanese dramas (dubbed dorama).  One of the best places to
look for dorama is
"D-Addicts":http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/torrents.php?tab=Custom&custom_search=custom_search&type_jdrama=jdrama&sub_english=English&csort=date_added&csortorder=DESC&start=0

The J-Doramas that get fansubbed are almost always romances, although
you might find the occasional action series or samurai drama.
However, all of the series that I've watched have been phenomenal.  I
highly recommend it.

The morality of downloading J-Dorama is slightly complicated by the
fact that there is no way of legally buying CDs of the episodes that
aren't region 2 encoded.  That means that people in North America
really can not purchase them.  As an aside I fail to understand the
rationale of encoding DVDs for a certain region when you know full
well that you never intend to sublicense them outside of the region.
Personally, I would love to support some of these series, but I have a
hard time justifying buying a DVD that I can't even play.  Well enough
of a rant...

Fansubs are an amazing resource for people learning Japanese.  You get
a ready supply of example sentences with translations.  Often the
translations of the fansubs are extremely good and include extensive
notes on Japanese culture.

What I like to do is watch it once just for the content.  Then I watch
it again, without looking at the subtitles -- just playing my "catch
the word" game.  Finally, I will watch it and consciously try to match
up the translation with the sound.  It's hard at first, but it gets
easier as time goes on.

One thing to watch about TV shows.  The language used may or may not
be typical in Japan.  Especially in anime the language can be very
familiar and colloquial.  Often they use language to indicate a
particular type of exaggerated personality (maybe rude, maybe shy,
etc).  Realize this and be careful.  It's best only to use language
that you really understand when talking to people.

Finally radio.  There are a few places to get Japanese radio on the
internet.  I use a P2P (peer 2 peer) program for internet radio
content called "Peercast":http://www.peercast.org/  Several large
Japanese radio stations are rebroadcast there.  Additionally, there
are several "garage radio stations" that broadcast their own content
(or things like anime music CDs).  These are all great language
resources (if again often infringing on copyright).

There are several more places on the internet to find japanese
resources.  Just keep googling around.  Eventually I will put up a
japanese resource page on this site.

h3. More to come later....

This page is already much longer than I thought it would be.  I will
continue later.
