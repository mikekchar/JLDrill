Usage
=====
After installing, on a GNU/Linux, BSD, or Unix-like system type
<pre>
    jldrill
</pre>
from the command line prompt.

On Windows you will have to do a little more.  You will have to navigate
to the ruby binary directory to run jldrill.  Usually this will be:

<pre>
    cd c:\ruby\bin
    ruby jldrill
</pre>

Main Window
-----------
This is what you see when you first start JLDrill.

![JLDrill Starting Screen](images/Start.png "JLDrill screenshot")

There's not much to do until you load a drill file.

Selecting a Drill File
-----------------------
You may open a drill file by clicking the "Open" button on the tool
bar.  You may also access this functionality by pressing Ctrl-O, or
selecting File/Open from the menu bar.  After doing so you will be
presented with the file open dialog.

![Quiz File Open Dialog](images/OpenQuiz.png "Quiz File Open Dialog")

There are many drill files available.  They include hiragana, katakana
and JLPT vocabulary levels 1-4.  JLDrill will automatically choose the
directory that contains the default drill files.

Note: The JLPT files currently have several problems with the translations.
Please cross reference any words (the Ctrl-X function) that you are
unfamiliar with. You can help: If you fix any translations, please
send them to me so that everyone can benefit.

Conducting the Quiz
-------------------
After loading the quiz file you will be presented with your first
question.  This will be shown in the top pane of the main window.

![Quiz Word is Displayed](images/Quiz.png "Quiz Word is Displayed")

Note: Currently you will be shown the kanji and the reading for
vocabulary in the question pane.  Eventually you will be able to drill
on the meanings and kanji alone.  Also, for some words in the JLPT
drills there is no kanji because it is not part of the curriculum for
that level.  In it's place will be a hint about what word it is
talking about.

I stole the idea for the UI from PyJFlash which I thought had a simple
but ingenious system.  What you do is guess the answer to the
question.  You do this to yourself without inputting anything into the
computer.  Then you click on the "Check" button (or "Z" key on the
keyboard) to see if you were right.

![Quiz Answer is Displayed](images/QuizAnswer.png "Quiz Answer is Displayed")

If you were right in your guess, you click on "Correct" ("C" on the
keyboard).  Otherwise you click on "Incorrect" ("X" on the keyboard).
After replying you will be presented with a new question.  If this
seems like a rather simplistic way of doing things, you are right.
What struck me about conducting the quiz this way is that there is a
minimum of UI to get in your way.  The drills can go very quickly.

Measuring Your Progress
-----------------------
The status of the quiz is displayed at the bottom screen and will look
something like: 

![Quiz Status](images/Status.png "Quiz Status")

First, the * on the left hand side means that the quiz has not been
saved yet.  As you progress through the quiz, it keeps track of your
progress.  If you save the file (and hence your progress), the * will
disappear. 

Following the modification indicator is the name of the quiz.
Currently this is just the file name of the dictionary that was used
to generate the quiz.  In this case, the quiz was generated from the JLPT 4
vocabulary file.  

Then you are shown the number of words in each proficiency category.
There are 5 categories: Unseen, Poor, Fair, Good and Excellent.  In
this case 504 words haven't been seen by you yet (Unseen).  1 word requires
much repetition (Poor), 9 require repetition but are OK (Fair), 77
only need to be repeated occasionally (Good) and 50 will be shown
rarely (Excellent).

The R(2,10) requires some explanation.  R means that new
vocabulary will be presented randomly.  Some quizes have a set
introduction order (like the Hiragana quiz).  The R will be missing in
that case.  Others (like this JLPT quiz) will give you new vocabulary
in a random order.

(2,10) is a reference to parameters in the training aglorithm.  It
indicates the speed at which new vocabulary will be introducted.


Training Algorithm
------------------
In the example, 2 is the number of times you have to get the word
correct before it will be "promoted" into the next higher slot.  So
once you get it right 2 times in a row, it will be moved from Poor to
Fair.  After 2 more times it will be moved to Good.  Finally, 2 more
times and it will be moved to Excellent.  If you ever get the word
wrong, it will be moved back to poor.

Depending on how well you know the word, it will be quizzed more or
less often.  Words in the poor category will be displayed 53% (8/15)
of the time, Fair 27% (4/15) of the time, good 13% (2/15) of the time
and excellent 7% (1/15) of the time.  

The 10 in the status line indicates the threshold for introducing new
words.  You are considered to know the word if it is in either the
good or excellent category.  As long as the words in the poor and fair
categories total less than 10, you will get new vocabulary.  That way
your pool of lesser known words is always at least 10 words.  

You can adjust these two parameters to fit your learning style.  If
it takes you more repetition to remember words, you can set the first
parameter to 3 or even 4.  Adjusting the second parameter will allow
you to quiz a more narrow or wide range of words.  These can set
this from the quiz preferences (Ctrl-P or Quiz/Preferences from the menu).

Saving Your Progress
--------------------
Remember to save your drill before you quit.  That way it will pick up
where you left off last time.  The first time you load a drill, you
might want to use the "Save As" entry from the menu bar (File/Save As, or
Ctrl-A) to save your drill under a different name.  This will allow
you to keep the original file unchanged.

At any time you can save the current file (using File/Save from the
menu, Ctrl-S, or clicking on the Toolbar).  If you quit the
application, or open up another drill, JLDrill will always ask you if
you want to save your file.

Non-Drill Features
------------------
**Reference Dictionary**.  This feature is useful in case
you want to check that the translation in the drill is correct.  It
allows you to cross reference the word against a dictionary
and edit it if necessary. 

Note: The JLPT files are known to have some inappropriate or incorrect
translations. This is very much a work in progress.  Please cross
reference any words that you don't know.  If you find errors, please
submit them back to me.

You can load a reference dictionary by pressing Ctrl-D (or selecting
File/Load Reference Dictionary from the menu)  The reference
dictionary distributed with JLDrill is the EDICT dictionary from
Monash University.  Note that it takes a long time (23 seconds on my
machine) to load the edict library.  A window with a progress bar will
be shown.  You are able to continue drilling while the dictionary is
loading, though.

After the Reference Dictionary has been loaded, you can cross
reference the currently quizzed word by pressing Ctrl-X (or selecting
Vocab/XReference from the menu).  This will bring up an incredibly
ugly display with the Word on the left hand side, a table of
candidates on the bottom and space for a selected word on the right
hand side.  

![Cross Reference with Dictionary](images/XReference.png "Cross Reference with Dictionary")

Currently, the dictionary lookup is by reading alone.  A kanji lookup
is also planned.  All you do is select one of the words at the bottom and
cut and past information between the reference word and the drill
word.   When you press OK, the new information will be added to the
drill.

Important: Remember to save the drill file afterwards so that the edit
is saved with the drill.

**Display** word.  You can display the details of a
word that you are drilling.  Just press D (or select Vocab/Display
from the menu).  You can edit this word if you want from here.

![View/Edit the Vocabulary](images/View.png "View/Edit the Vocabulary")

**Show all**. Will show a table of all the words in the
drill.

![View all the Vocabulary](images/AllVocab.png "View all the Vocabulary")

**Reset**.  You can reset the drill so
that all the words are Unseen again.  Press Ctrl-R or select
Drill/Reset from the menu to do this.

**Info**. Show information about the current drill.
This is just information that the drill author wants to show.  It
might contain copyright information or other interesting things.
Pressing Ctrl-I or selecting Drill/Info from the menu will display
this dialog.

**Create a new Drill**.  You can create a new drill by
importing any UTF8 encoded EDict file.  Just open the file (JLDrill
will automatically recognize the file type) and then save it to
another name. Going up one directory from the quizes, you will find a
director called "dict". In this directory you will find the files that
generated the drill.  Additionally you will find the Mainichi Shinbun
Frequency files.  Finally you will also find the whole edict.utf file
in case you want to drill yourself on all 120,000 words in the
dictionary. 

That's it.  Hope you find it useful. Please see the Planned Features
to see what's coming up next.
