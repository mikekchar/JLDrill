Usage
=====
After installing, on a GNU/Linux, BSD, or Unix-like system type
<pre>
    jldrill
</pre>
from the command line prompt.

On Windows you will have to do a little more.  You will have to navigate
to the ruby binary directory to run jldrill.  Usually this will be:

<pre>
    cd c:\ruby\bin
    ruby jldrill
</pre>

Main Window
-----------
This is what you see when you first start JLDrill.

![JLDrill Starting Screen](images/Start.png "JLDrill screenshot")

There's not much to do until you load a drill file.

Selecting a Drill File
-----------------------
You may open a drill file by clicking the "Open" button on the tool
bar.  You may also access this functionality by pressing Ctrl-O, or
selecting File/Open from the menu bar.  After doing so you will be
presented with the file open dialog.

![Quiz File Open Dialog](images/OpenQuiz.png "Quiz File Open Dialog")

There are many drill files available.  They include hiragana, katakana,
JLPT vocabulary levels 1-4 and grammar.  JLDrill will automatically choose the
directory that contains the default drill files.

Note: Levels 1 and 2 of the JLPT files have some incorrect
translations.  Please cross reference the vocabulary with the dictionary
to ensure that they are correct (see below).  Also, the grammar
drill is a work in progress and contains only about half
of the material from Tae Kim's Japanese Guide to Japanese Grammar.

Conducting the Quiz
-------------------
After loading the quiz file you will be presented with your first
question.  This will be shown in the top pane of the main window.

![Quiz Word is Displayed](images/Quiz.png "Quiz Word is Displayed")

The first time you see an item you will be shown the kanji
and reading for the word.  You should try to guess what the
english meaning of the word is.  When you think you know,
or you've given up, you click on "Check" ("Z" on the keyboard).

![Quiz Answer is Displayed](images/QuizAnswer.png "Quiz Answer is Displayed")

If you were right in your guess, you click on "Correct" ("C" on the
keyboard).  Otherwise you click on "Incorrect" ("X" on the keyboard).
After replying you will be presented with a new question.  In this manner
you are introduced to new material.

Measuring Your Progress
-----------------------
The status of the quiz is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  When you
first load a quiz, it will look like this:

![Quiz Status](images/Status.png "Quiz Status")

First, the * on the left hand side means that the quiz has not been
saved yet.  As you progress through the quiz, it keeps track of your
progress.  If you save the file (and hence your progress), the * will
disappear. 

Following the modification indicator is a count of the items in
each set of the quiz.  JLDrill divides the quiz into 3 sets: The
New set, The Review set and the Working set.

###The New Set

The new set contains all the items that you have never seen before.
When you first start a quiz, all of the items are put in the new
set.  Then one item is chosen to be displayed to you.  So in the
example above, there are 672 items in the new set. Since one is being
displayed, you know that there are a total of 673 items in the drill.

###The Review Set

After you memorize an item, it will be placed into the review set.
We have just started and no items have been memorized, so you can see
that the review set contains 0 items.

###The Working Set

The working set contains the items that you are currently memorizing.
The maximum number of items allowed in the working set depends on the drill.
Usually, it is set to 10 items, but you can adjust this number in the options.
The working set is further divided into 3 levels (levels 1, 2 and 3).  When
you first start to learn an item, it is placed in level 1.  As you learn it,
it advances to the second and third level.  After you master the third level,
it is considered *memorized* and is moved into the review set.  In the example
above, you can see that the count is 1,0,0 which means that there is one item
at level 1 and zero items at levels 2 and 3.

The next thing on the status is an indicator of the item currently
being drilled.  You will notice it says "1 -> 5.0 days".  The number
on the left hand side indicates where the currently drilled item
came from.  In this case, it is a level 1 item from the working set.
If it were level 2, then the number would be 2.  Level 3 would be 3.
Items from the review set have a "+" in front of them.  They will
be described later.

After the level indicator is the *potential schedule* for the item.
After you memorize an item, JLDrill will put it in the review set and
schedule it for review sometime in the future.  The potential schedule
is the approximate amount of time that JLDrill will wait before showing
the item to you again.  While the item is in the working set, JLDrill
keeps track of the number of times you successfully guessed the right
answer.  It uses this value to create the potential schedule.  The
value displayed is the scheduled amount of time that will be used
if you continue to guess the item correctly until it is memorized.
More will be said about this later.

Finally there is an indicator showing whether or not JLDrill is
in "review mode" or "new item mode".  Since we have just started,
JLDrill will select items to put into the working set from the
new set, rather than the review set.  It displays "New Items" to
indicate this.  More detail on "review mode" and "new item mode"
will be discussed later.

Learning and Reviewing
----------------------

JLDrill's strategy for introducing items into the quiz is at the
same time complicated to describe and easy to use.  If you want to
understand the nitty gritty details, along with a rationale for
the choices made, please see [the strategy documentation](Strategy.html).
But for those who just want to use the program, a brief description
of what is going on, follows.

As has been mentioned, when you first start a drill, all items are
put into the new set.  Then one item is selected (either the first
item in the drill, or at random according to the options set) to
be quized.  This item is placed into level 1 of the working set.
Once you quiz the item and select either "correct" or "incorrect",
a new item is selected from the new set and placed into level 1
of the working set.  This continues until the working set is full.

The size of the working set is dependent upon the drill, but by
default it is 10 items.  You can see that every time a new item
is introduced, the number of items in level 1 in the working set
increases.

![Quiz Status with Full Working Set](images/Status-WorkingFull.png "Quiz Status with Full Working Set")

Here you can see that the working set has 10 items in level 1.

At this point, JLDrill will stop adding new items to the working set.
Instead, it will randomly select an item from the working set for
you to try again.  You can think of the working set like a deck of
cards.  It draws one card and then presents it to you.  Then it draws
another card.  Once all 10 items in the working set have been presented,
it reshuffles the deck and starts again.

Note: Occasionally after the working set has been shuffled it will
present the same item it just presented, showing the same item
twice in a row.  This is unfortunate.  A release in the future will correct 
this behaviour.

### Going to the Next Level

If you get an item correct two times in a row, it will be *promoted*
to the next level.  The second time you get the item correct, you will
notice that the number of level 2 items will increase and the number
of level 1 items will decrease.

![Quiz Status Promoting to Level 2](images/Status-Level2Promote.png "Quiz Status Promoting to Level 2")

Here you can see that there are now 9 items at level 1 in the working set
and 1 item at level 2.

The next item you get to this item you will notice something different.

![A Level 2 Item](images/Level2Item.png "A level 2 item")

In the top pane (the question pane), you will notice that the quiz now
only shows you the kanji.  You must now remember the meaning *and* the
reading for the item.  What happens if you get this one wrong now?

Every time you get an item wrong, it is *demoted* back to level 1.
Also, the *potential schedule* for the item is reduced.  This is what
the item looks like after we've gotten it wrong and drill it again.

![A Demoted Item](images/Level2Demoted.png "A Demoted Item")

Here you can see we've drilled all the other items and gotten back to
our demoted item.  From the "1 --> 4.2 days" in the status bar, you
can see that it is again a level 1 item and that the potential schedule
is now 4.2 days rather than 5.0 days.  Each time you get an item
incorrect, the potential schedule will decrease.

Eventually we will start to get our item correct as we learn it.
When it is correct twice in a row, it will be promoted to level
2.  When it is correct twice more from there, it will be promoted
to level 3 (i.e., it has been guessed 4 times in a row correctly).
The quiz then looks like this.

![A Level 3 Item](images/Level3Item.png "A Level 3 Item")

You will notice that the question pane has the english meaning now.
The answer pane has the kanji and the reading.  You should be able
to say the Japanese word for the item.  You should also know what
kanji it is using.  Finally, notice that the Status bar now
contains "3 --> 4.2 days." indicating that this item is level 3 and
it has a potential schedule of 4.2 days.

### Review Mode


Options
-------
You can adjust these two parameters to fit your learning style.  If
it takes you more repetition to remember words, you can set the first
parameter to 3 or even 4.  Adjusting the second parameter will allow
you to quiz a more narrow or wide range of words.  These can set
this from the quiz preferences (Ctrl-P or Quiz/Preferences from the menu).

![Quiz Options](images/Options.png "Quiz Options")

Saving Your Progress
--------------------
Remember to save your drill before you quit.  That way it will pick up
where you left off last time.  The first time you load a drill, you
might want to use the "Save As" entry from the menu bar (File/Save As, or
Ctrl-A) to save your drill under a different name.  This will allow
you to keep the original file unchanged.

At any time you can save the current file (using File/Save from the
menu, Ctrl-S, or clicking on the Toolbar).  If you quit the
application, or open up another drill, JLDrill will always ask you if
you want to save your file.

Non-Drill Features
------------------
**Reference Dictionary**.  This feature is useful in case
you want to check that the translation in the drill is correct.  It
allows you to cross reference the word against a dictionary
and edit it if necessary. 

Note: The JLPT files are known to have some inappropriate or incorrect
translations. This is very much a work in progress.  Please cross
reference any words that you don't know.  If you find errors, please
submit them back to me.

You can load a reference dictionary by pressing Ctrl-D (or selecting
File/Load Reference Dictionary from the menu)  The reference
dictionary distributed with JLDrill is the EDICT dictionary from
Monash University.  Note that it takes a long time (23 seconds on my
machine) to load the edict library.  A window with a progress bar will
be shown.  You are able to continue drilling while the dictionary is
loading, though.

After the Reference Dictionary has been loaded, you can cross
reference the currently quizzed word by pressing Ctrl-X (or selecting
Vocab/XReference from the menu).  This will bring up an incredibly
ugly display with the Word on the left hand side, a table of
candidates on the bottom and space for a selected word on the right
hand side.  

![Cross Reference with Dictionary](images/XReference.png "Cross Reference with Dictionary")

Currently, the dictionary lookup is by reading alone.  A kanji lookup
is also planned.  All you do is select one of the words at the bottom and
cut and past information between the reference word and the drill
word.   When you press OK, the new information will be added to the
drill.

Important: Remember to save the drill file afterwards so that the edit
is saved with the drill.

**Display** word.  You can display the details of a
word that you are drilling.  Just press D (or select Vocab/Display
from the menu).  You can edit this word if you want from here.

![View/Edit the Vocabulary](images/View.png "View/Edit the Vocabulary")

**Show all**. Will show a table of all the words in the
drill.

![View all the Vocabulary](images/AllVocab.png "View all the Vocabulary")

**Reset**.  You can reset the drill so
that all the words are Unseen again.  Press Ctrl-R or select
Drill/Reset from the menu to do this.

**Info**. Show information about the current drill.
This is just information that the drill author wants to show.  It
might contain copyright information or other interesting things.
Pressing Ctrl-I or selecting Drill/Info from the menu will display
this dialog.

**Create a new Drill**.  You can create a new drill by
importing any UTF8 encoded EDict file.  Just open the file (JLDrill
will automatically recognize the file type) and then save it to
another name. Going up one directory from the quizes, you will find a
director called "dict". In this directory you will find the files that
generated the drill.  Additionally you will find the Mainichi Shinbun
Frequency files.  Finally you will also find the whole edict.utf file
in case you want to drill yourself on all 120,000 words in the
dictionary. 

That's it.  Hope you find it useful. Please see the Planned Features
to see what's coming up next.
