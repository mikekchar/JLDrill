Usage
=====
From a command prompt (from Windows: Start->Programs->Accessories->Command) 
type:
<pre>
    jldrill
</pre>

Note: On a Debian based Linux system, if you install the ruby-gems package
the gems do not get put on your path.  You have to add /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin
to your path.

Main Window
-----------
This is what you see when you first start JLDrill.

![JLDrill Starting Screen](images/Start.png "JLDrill screenshot")

There's not much to do until you load a drill file.

Selecting a Drill File
-----------------------
You may open a drill file by clicking the "Open" button on the tool
bar.  You may also access this functionality by pressing Ctrl-O, or
selecting File/Open from the menu bar.  After doing so you will be
presented with the file open dialog.

![Quiz File Open Dialog](images/OpenQuiz.png "Quiz File Open Dialog")

There are many drill files available.  They include hiragana, katakana,
JLPT vocabulary levels 1-4 and grammar.  JLDrill will automatically choose the
directory that contains the default drill files.

Note: Levels 1 and 2 of the JLPT files have some incorrect
translations.  Please cross reference the vocabulary with the dictionary
to ensure that they are correct (see below).  Also, the grammar
drill is a work in progress and contains only about half
of the material from Tae Kim's Japanese Guide to Japanese Grammar.

Conducting the Quiz
-------------------
After loading the quiz file you will be presented with your first
question.  This will be shown in the top pane of the main window.

![Quiz Word is Displayed](images/Quiz.png "Quiz Word is Displayed")

The first time you see an item you will be shown the kanji
and reading for the word.  You should try to guess what the
english meaning of the word is.  When you think you know,
or you've given up, you click on "Check" ("Z" on the keyboard).

![Quiz Answer is Displayed](images/QuizAnswer.png "Quiz Answer is Displayed")

If you were right in your guess, you click on "Correct" ("C" on the
keyboard).  Otherwise you click on "Incorrect" ("X" on the keyboard).
After replying you will be presented with a new question.  In this manner
you are introduced to new material.

Measuring Your Progress
-----------------------
The status of the quiz is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  When you
first load a quiz, it will look like this:

![Quiz Status](images/Status.png "Quiz Status")

First, the * on the left hand side means that the quiz has not been
saved yet.  As you progress through the quiz, it keeps track of your
progress.  If you save the file (and hence your progress), the * will
disappear. 

Following the modification indicator is a count of the items in
each set of the quiz.  JLDrill divides the quiz into 3 sets: The
New set, The Review set and the Working set.

###The New Set

The new set contains all the items that you have never seen before.
When you first start a quiz, all of the items are put in the new
set.  Then one item is chosen to be displayed to you.  So in the
example above, there are 672 items in the new set. Since one is being
displayed, you know that there are a total of 673 items in the drill.

###The Review Set

After you memorize an item, it will be placed into the review set.
We have just started and no items have been memorized, so you can see
that the review set contains 0 items.

###The Working Set

The working set contains the items that you are currently memorizing.
The maximum number of items allowed in the working set depends on the drill.
Usually, it is set to 10 items, but you can adjust this number in the options.
The working set is further divided into 3 levels (levels 1, 2 and 3).  When
you first start to learn an item, it is placed in level 1.  As you learn it,
it advances to the second and third level.  After you master the third level,
it is considered *memorized* and is moved into the review set.  In the example
above, you can see that the count is 1,0,0 which means that there is one item
at level 1 and zero items at levels 2 and 3.

The next thing on the status is an indicator of the item currently
being drilled.  You will notice it says "1 -> 5.0 days".  The number
on the left hand side indicates where the currently drilled item
came from.  In this case, it is a level 1 item from the working set.
If it were level 2, then the number would be 2.  Level 3 would be 3.
Items from the review set have a "+" in front of them.  They will
be described later.

After the level indicator is the *potential schedule* for the item.
After you memorize an item, JLDrill will put it in the review set and
schedule it for review sometime in the future.  The potential schedule
is the approximate amount of time that JLDrill will wait before showing
the item to you again.  While the item is in the working set, JLDrill
keeps track of the number of times you successfully guessed the right
answer.  It uses this value to create the potential schedule.  The
value displayed is the scheduled amount of time that will be used
if you continue to guess the item correctly until it is memorized.
More will be said about this later.

Finally there is an indicator showing whether or not JLDrill is
in "review mode" or "new item mode".  Since we have just started,
JLDrill will select items to put into the working set from the
new set, rather than the review set.  It displays "New Items" to
indicate this.  More detail on "review mode" and "new item mode"
will be discussed later.

Learning and Reviewing
----------------------

JLDrill's strategy for introducing items into the quiz is at the
same time complicated to describe and easy to use.  If you want to
understand the nitty gritty details, along with a rationale for
the choices made, please see [the strategy documentation](Strategy.html).
But for those who just want to use the program, a brief description
of what is going on, follows.

As has been mentioned, when you first start a drill, all items are
put into the new set.  Then one item is selected (either the first
item in the drill, or at random according to the options set) to
be quized.  This item is placed into level 1 of the working set.
Once you quiz the item and select either "correct" or "incorrect",
a new item is selected from the new set and placed into level 1
of the working set.  This continues until the working set is full.

The size of the working set is dependent upon the drill, but by
default it is 10 items.  You can see that every time a new item
is introduced, the number of items in level 1 in the working set
increases.

![Quiz Status with Full Working Set](images/Status-WorkingFull.png "Quiz Status with Full Working Set")

Here you can see that the working set has 10 items in level 1.

At this point, JLDrill will stop adding new items to the working set.
Instead, it will randomly select an item from the working set for
you to try again.  You can think of the working set like a deck of
cards.  It draws one card and then presents it to you.  Then it draws
another card.  Once all 10 items in the working set have been presented,
it reshuffles the deck and starts again.

Note: Occasionally after the working set has been shuffled it will
present the same item it just presented, showing the same item
twice in a row.  This is unfortunate.  A release in the future will correct 
this behaviour.

### Going to the Next Level

If you get an item correct two times in a row, it will be *promoted*
to the next level.  The second time you get the item correct, you will
notice that the number of level 2 items will increase and the number
of level 1 items will decrease.

![Quiz Status Promoting to Level 2](images/Status-Level2Promote.png "Quiz Status Promoting to Level 2")

Here you can see that there are now 9 items at level 1 in the working set
and 1 item at level 2.

The next item you get to this item you will notice something different.

![A Level 2 Item](images/Level2Item.png "A level 2 item")

In the top pane (the question pane), you will notice that the quiz now
only shows you the kanji.  You must now remember the meaning *and* the
reading for the item.  What happens if you get this one wrong now?

Every time you get an item wrong, it is *demoted* back to level 1.
Also, the *potential schedule* for the item is reduced.  This is what
the item looks like after we've gotten it wrong and drill it again.

![A Demoted Item](images/Level2Demoted.png "A Demoted Item")

Here you can see we've drilled all the other items and gotten back to
our demoted item.  From the "1 --> 4.2 days" in the status bar, you
can see that it is again a level 1 item and that the potential schedule
is now 4.2 days rather than 5.0 days.  Each time you get an item
incorrect, the potential schedule will decrease.

Eventually we will start to get our item correct as we learn it.
When it is correct twice in a row, it will be promoted to level
2.  When it is correct twice more from there, it will be promoted
to level 3 (i.e., it has been guessed 4 times in a row correctly).
The quiz then looks like this.

![A Level 3 Item](images/Level3Item.png "A Level 3 Item")

You will notice that the question pane has the english meaning now.
The answer pane has the kanji and the reading.  You should be able
to say the Japanese word for the item.  You should also know what
kanji it is using.  Finally, notice that the Status bar now
contains "3 --> 4.2 days." indicating that this item is level 3 and
it has a potential schedule of 4.2 days.

When you have gotten a level 3 item correct 2 times in a row, it
will be considered "memorized".  At this point it will be promoted
to the review set.  How it is treated in the review set will be
discussed below, but having been promoted it leaves a spot in
the working set.  This spot will be filled by an item from the
new set, unless you are in review mode (see below).

In this way, you review items over and over again until they
are memorized.  When you memorize one item in the working set,
it is replaced by a new item from the new set.  Slowly, over
time, you will eventually memorize all the items from the
new set.

### Review Mode

Once an item has been memorized in the working set, it is
promoted to the review set.  Unlike the working set, the
review set items have a definite order.  They are ordered
by the "potential schedule" that the item has when it is
promoted.

For example, the item that we were discussing previously
has a potential schedule of 4.2 days.  When it is promoted
into the review set it will be inserted into the set
according to this schedule.  In other words, it will be placed
after items with a potential schedule of 3 days, and before items
with a potential schedule of 5 days for instance.

Over time, the potential schedule decreases.  So if we put
an item in the review set with a potential schedule of
4.2 days, after waiting one day it will have a potential
schedule of 3.2 days.  If the item remains in the review set
for a long time, it can even have a potential schedule
below zero.  This means you are "behind" on this item.
More about this will be discussed later.

Items in the review set are displayed when you are in "review
mode".  You automatically enter review mode when you first
start the application.  At any other time, you can enter review
mode by pressing the "Review Mode" button at the top right of
the window.

Note: The application won't enter review mode unless you have
at least the same number of items in the review set as you do
in the working set (default 10).  That's why you don't
enter review mode the first time you start a quiz.

When the application is in review mode it continues to operate
normally.  You are continually tested on items from the working
set.  However, when an item from the working set is promoted
into the review set it leaves a gap in the working set.  In
review mode, this gap is filled by an item from the review set.

![Review Mode Item](images/ReviewModeItem.png "A Review Mode Item")

In this picture the item has been promoted into the review set.
Then we quit the application and restarted it later in the day.
As you can see from the status line we have 10 items in the review
set, so the application automatically entered review mode.  Eventually
it displayed this item.

Inspecting the status line, you can see that part of it has changed.
It now reads "+1, Today --> 4.2 days" where the level and potential schedule
were displayed previously.  In this case, "+1" refers to the number of
times this item has been reviewed in review mode.  This is the first time,
so it is level 1.  Every time we get the item right in a row, the level
increases.

"Today" refers to the last time this item was reviewed.  In reality, I
just quit the application and restarted it, so the last time we reviewed
the item was today.   If we reviewed it last yesterday, it would say
"Yesterday", otherwise it just prints the date.  Finally we can see the
potential schedule if we get the item correct.

Before I make a discussion of scheduling, I would like to discuss the
last item on the status line.  It says "50%".  When you are in review
mode, the application keeps track of the percentage of items you got
right in the last 10 attempts.  Unbeknownst to you, I reviewed a few
items before this one and got 50 percent of them right.

The percentage is a guide to show you when review mode will end.  If
you can maintain a success rate of 90% in the last 10 attempts, the
program will go into "countdown mode".  In this mode, if you manage
to keep your success rate at 90% or above for 9 more items, then
review mode will end and you will go back to "new items" mode.

You can tell when you are in countdown mode because the percentage will
look something like "90% - 5", meaning that you have answered 90%
of the last 10 questions correctly and that you have 5 more questions
before review mode ends.

The system will continue asking you questions from the review set
until you get one wrong, or review mode ends.  If you get one wrong,
it is placed into the gap in the working set and quizzing resumes
as normal.  If the review mode ends, then the system goes into
new item mode and a new item is selected for the gap.

Scheduling
----------

In most spaced repetion applications, each item has a fixed date
when it is scheduled to be reviewed.  When that date has passed, the
item is reviewed.  JLDrill doesn't work like that.

Instead it has a "potential schedule".  The items are then sorted
by the potential schedule.  You then review items until you seem
to be getting at least 90% of them correct.  The reason for this is
simple.

When the items are scheduled, JLDrill puts  alot of effort to
ensure that the items you are most likely to forget are placed at
the front of the list.  Items that you are least likely to forget
are placed at the back.  As you review, you will notice that your
rate of success gets better and better.  Once your rate of
success is 90% or more, then there is little point to reviewing
any more.  We will be better off to learn new items at this point.

While you are in review mode, when you get an item correct,
it is given a potential schedule of twice the amount of time
since the last review.  For example, if we haven't reviewed the
item for 2 days and then get the item correct, it will be given
a potential schedule of 4 days.  In this way the gap between
successful reviews will get longer and longer.

But it's important to realize that the "potential schedule" is
not the actual time that it will be reviewed.  It just represents
the order in which the items are sorted.  When you actually review
the item will depend on how well you remember the items.  When you
get to 90% correct, you stop reviewing.  

In other words, JLDrill automatically adjusts the scheduling for
you.  If you have difficulty remembering items, then they will
show up more often.  If you remember them easily, then they will
appear less often.  I believe this is a significant advantage over
other spaced repetition algorithms.

However, you may have noticed that the item we reviewed today
started with a potential schedule of 4.2 days, and after we
successfully reviewed it once, still had a schedule of 4.2 days.
I had only just promoted it a few minutes ago, so the total
schedule should have been twice that -- or only minutes.

In reality, it actually does.  What happened was that the
item was scheduled for 4.2 potential days.  But I reviewed
all the items for those 4.2 days in just a couple of minutes.
So the program adjusts for this and creates the new scheduled
date from the old scheduled date.  In this case, we have
a few minutes plus 4.2 days, which ends up being about 4.2 days
(once the numbers are rounded off).

Note: Probably I should scale the schedule.  In other words,
I should keep track of the scheduled time vs the actual time
and scale the new schedule accordingly.  I may do that in
a future release.

All this talk of scheduling may be confusing.  If you don't
understand, don't worry about it.  The only important point
is that the program is designed to keep your items roughly
in order of the chance you have of forgetting them.  When you
know all the items in the list with 90% chance of success,
it gives you new items.

There is a caveat, which again is mostly unimportant,
but possibly interesting if you want to understand what's going
on.  If you successfully review an item in the review
set, it won't be shown again that session.  If you quit the application
and start again, you might see it if the potential schedule is small
enough.

Getting Behind
--------------

![Getting Behind](images/Behind.png "Getting Behind")

Here you can see a situation that happens from time to time.  In
the status bar, beside the working set information you can see
the words "Behind: 577".  When an item has a potential schedule of
less than 0 (i.e., it sat in the review set without being reviewed
for longer than it's original schedule), then it is known as
being "behind".

In this case, I'm behind by 577 items.  You will definitely be
behind from time to time.  The algorithm is designed to adjust
for your speed, so occasionally you will find that some items
will get behind naturally.  Or sometimes you take a couple of
days off and the items have gotten behind.

As long as you can review all the items in a day or so, it doesn't
create much difficulty.  In order to help yourself out, you can go
into review mode by pushing the button in the top right corner.
This will stop the program from ever going into new items mode even
if you get every item correct.  This is a good way to clear out a backlog.

But in my sad case, I'm just not going to be able to review 577
items in a reasonable timeframe.  There are multiple problems with this.
First, the algorithm is designed to keep things in rough order
in the schedule.  But when items get behind they slowly go out of
order.  Because you will forget items at different rates, you
can no longer rely on statistics to tell you when to stop reviewing.

But the next problem is worse.  If you have several days of items
that are behind, it will take you several days to get to the back
of the list.  Items are only scheduled in the future, so it will
take several days before you re-review items.  At this point you
may have forgotten them.  You can easily get into a state where
your success rate is low enough that you can no longer learn
anything new -- you will be spinning your wheels just trying to
keep up with the backlog.

So, if at all possible, review your items every day -- in fact, review
them several times a day if you can.  Short frequent sessions are
better than long sessions every once in a while.  However, you should
always aim to get out of review mode each time you run the application.
That way you will not fall behind.

But if you get behind like I have, you have no choice.  You will
have to reset the drill (Drill->Reset, or press Ctrl-R) and start again.

Note: In a future release there will be a way to "forget" items that
are behind.  This will put them back in the new list.

Options
-------
If you press Ctrl-P or select Quiz/Preferences from the menu, you can
alter a few options for the quiz.

![Quiz Options](images/Options.png "Quiz Options")

Right now only a few things are available to be changed.  The first is
whether or not items from the new set are introduced randomly.  If you
check the box, they will be.  If the box is unchecked, the items will
be introduced in the order they appear in the file.

The next slider allows you to set the number of times an item must
be guessed correctly before it is promoted to the next level.  I
have found settings of 1 and 2 to be most useful.  For grammar, it
is set to 1 because you don't really want to memorize the item,
just practice it.  Setting this value to 3 or higher might be
useful if you are having a really difficult time remembering things
in the working set.

However, another thing you can do is alter the number of items in the
working set.  This is controlled by the next slider.  Usually this is
set to 10, but you can change it to whatever you like.  The more items
you have in the working set, the longer it will take between reviews
of the item. If the material is quite easy for you, you might want to make
this large.  If it is very difficult, you can make the value small.

The last slider sets the quiz strategy version.  This is not used
at all and will be removed soon.

Saving Your Progress
--------------------
Remember to save your drill before you quit.  That way it will pick up
where you left off last time.  The first time you load a drill, you
might want to use the "Save As" entry from the menu bar (File/Save As, or
Ctrl-A) to save your drill under a different name.  This will allow
you to keep the original file unchanged.

At any time you can save the current file (using File/Save from the
menu, Ctrl-S, or clicking on the Toolbar).  If you quit the
application, or open up another drill, JLDrill will always ask you if
you want to save your file.

Non-Drill Features
------------------
**Reference Dictionary**.  This feature is useful in case
you want to check that the translation in the drill is correct.  It
allows you to cross reference the word against a dictionary
and edit it if necessary. 

Note: The JLPT files are known to have some inappropriate or incorrect
translations. This is very much a work in progress.  Please cross
reference any words that you don't know.  If you find errors, please
submit them back to me.

You can load a reference dictionary by pressing Ctrl-D (or selecting
File/Load Reference Dictionary from the menu)  The reference
dictionary distributed with JLDrill is the EDICT dictionary from
Monash University.  Note that it takes a long time (23 seconds on my
machine) to load the edict library.  A window with a progress bar will
be shown.  You are able to continue drilling while the dictionary is
loading, though.

After the Reference Dictionary has been loaded, you can cross
reference the currently quizzed word by pressing Ctrl-X (or selecting
Vocab/XReference from the menu).  This will bring up an incredibly
ugly display with the Word on the left hand side, a table of
candidates on the bottom and space for a selected word on the right
hand side.  

![Cross Reference with Dictionary](images/XReference.png "Cross Reference with Dictionary")

Currently, the dictionary lookup is by reading alone.  A kanji lookup
is also planned.  All you do is select one of the words at the bottom and
cut and past information between the reference word and the drill
word.   When you press OK, the new information will be added to the
drill.

Important: Remember to save the drill file afterwards so that the edit
is saved with the drill.

**Display** word.  You can display the details of a
word that you are drilling.  Just press D (or select Vocab/Display
from the menu).  You can edit this word if you want from here.

![View/Edit the Vocabulary](images/View.png "View/Edit the Vocabulary")

**Show all**. Will show a table of all the words in the
drill.

![View all the Vocabulary](images/AllVocab.png "View all the Vocabulary")

**Reset**.  You can reset the drill so
that all the words are Unseen again.  Press Ctrl-R or select
Drill/Reset from the menu to do this.

**Info**. Show information about the current drill.
This is just information that the drill author wants to show.  It
might contain copyright information or other interesting things.
Pressing Ctrl-I or selecting Drill/Info from the menu will display
this dialog.

**Create a new Drill**.  You can create a new drill by
importing any UTF8 encoded EDict file.  Just open the file (JLDrill
will automatically recognize the file type) and then save it to
another name. Going up one directory from the quizes, you will find a
director called "dict". In this directory you will find the files that
generated the drill.  Additionally you will find the Mainichi Shinbun
Frequency files.  Finally you will also find the whole edict.utf file
in case you want to drill yourself on all 120,000 words in the
dictionary. 

That's it.  Hope you find it useful. Please see the Planned Features
to see what's coming up next.
