- The JLPT2 list has an incorrect entry for 開ける.  When I
  edited it, the it still said it differed. When I checked it (Z)
  the program crashed in Vocabulary.processOutput.  I tried to
  duplicate the problem, but I can't.

- When a drill is reset all the items go into the new set.  But
  the last item is still in the current problem.  Not sure what
  to do.  

- Can't use / in the text of items

- When you first start a file it will be in new item mode.  Then after
  you go for a while it will go into review mode.  It should stay in
  new item mode.
