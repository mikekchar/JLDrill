- When a drill is reset all the items go into the new set.  But
  the last item is still in the current problem.  Not sure what
  to do.  

- When you first start a file it will be in new item mode.  Then after
  you go for a while it will go into review mode.  It should stay in
  new item mode.
  
- Some items are flagged as differing from the dictionary even though
  they don't. (This may be fixed -- if you notice it, please tell me)
  
- The Loading Reference bar does not get updated.  The program
  hangs while the reference dictionary is loaded.  This appears to
  be a bug in rubygtk.  Trying to find a way to get around it.

- The FileSelector gets a G_IS_OBJECT failed assertion when the window
  is closed.  I think it's because I'm not doing things in exactly the
  same order that GTK expects.  I'll have to chase this one down
  someday, but it's not a huge problem AFAICT.
