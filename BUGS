- Going to a new item in the main window should automatically update
  the edit window (Note: This is *not* the case for the Add window!!!)
- Packing on the VocabularyView window is ridiculous.  Things don't
  resize properly.
- When a drill is reset all the items go into the new set.  But
  the last item is still in the current problem.  Not sure what
  to do.  
- Can't use / in the text of items
- When you first start a file it will be in new item mode.  Then after
  you go for a while it will go into review mode.  It should stay in
  new item mode until you start the application again or press
  the Review Mode button.
- The VocabularyView is ugly and hard to edit.
