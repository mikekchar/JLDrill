- Currently does a saveAs if the save fails.  But it doesn't
  give the user any information as to why this is happening.
  It should explain this.
- When a drill is reset all the items go into the new set.  But
  the last item is still in the current problem.  Not sure what
  to do.  
- Can't use / in the text of items
- When you first start a file it will be in new item mode.  Then after
  you go for a while it will go into review mode.  It should stay in
  new item mode until you start the application again or press
  the Review Mode button.
- The VocabularyView is ugly and hard to edit.  
- Something makes the open dialog really small sometimes.
  Currently I think this is a Gtk bug
