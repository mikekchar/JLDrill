The following people have helped (knowingly or unknowingly) in the
development of JLDrill:

Nicholas Doyle: Initial Pre-alpha testing
Mathieu Blondel (author of Nihongo Benkyo): Design discussions, and I
stole make_release.sh from him.
Jim Breem: For compiling and making available EDICT, without which a
drill program would be impossible.
Thierry Bezecourt: For compiling and making available the JLPT
vocabulary files.  This saved me *much* time
Don Kelly: For encouraging me to look at Ruby.
