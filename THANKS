The following people have helped (knowingly or unknowingly) in the
development of JLDrill:

Nicholas Doyle: Initial Pre-alpha testing
Mathieu Blondel (author of Fantasdic): Design discussions.
Jim Breem: For compiling and making available EDICT, without which a
           drill program would be impossible.
Thierry Bezecourt: For compiling and making available the JLPT
                   vocabulary files.  This saved me *much* time
Don Kelly: For encouraging me to look at Ruby.
Tae Kim: For the Japanese Guide to Japanese Grammar.  This is the best
         Japanese textbook I've ever read.
The Ottawa Coding Dojo: Various discussions and help.
Sagara Koutougakkou and Japanese Taxpayers: For giving me a job with enough
                                            free time that I can work on my
                                            own projects.
